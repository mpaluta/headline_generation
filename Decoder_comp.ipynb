The signature is thought to have originated in Central Asia, not the Near East, which is the ancestral home of Jews. The finding raises the question of how the signature became so widespread among the Levites, an ancient caste of hereditary Jewish priests. The genetic signature occurs on the male or Y chromosome and comes from a few men, or perhaps a single ancestor, who lived about 1,000 years ago, just as the Ashkenazim were beginning to be established in Europe. Ashkenazim, from whom most American Jews descend, are one of the two main branches of Jews, the other being the Sephardim, whose ancestors were expelled from Spain. The new report, published in the current issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics, was prepared by population geneticists in Israel, the United States and England, who have been studying the genetics of Jewish communities for the last six years. They say that 52 percent of Levites of Ashkenazi origin have a particular genetic signature that originated in Central Asia, although it is also found less frequently in the Middle East. The ancestor who introduced it into the Ashkenazi Levites could perhaps have been from the Khazars, a Turkic tribe whose king converted to Judaism in the eighth or ninth century, the researchers suggest. Their reasoning is that the signature, a set of DNA variations known as R1a1, is common in the region north of Georgia that was once occupied by the Khazar kingdom. The signature did reach the Near East, probably before the founding of the Jewish community, but it is still rare there. The scholars say they cannot exclude the possibility that a Jewish founder brought the signature on his Y chromosome to the Ashkenazi population, but they consider that a less likely explanation. The present descendants of the Khazars have not been identified. Dr. Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona, one of the authors of the report, said he was looking among the Chuvash, a Turkic-speaking people of the Volga Valley, to see if they might have contributed the R1a1 signature. Dr. Shaye Cohen, professor of Hebrew literature and philosophy at Harvard University, said he could see no problem with outsiders being converted to the Jewish community. He said he considered it less probable, however, that outsiders would become Levites, let alone founding members of the Levite community in Europe. The connection with the Khazars is ''all hypothesis,'' he said. Even if the Khazar hypothesis is correct, it would have no practical effect on who is a Levite today. ''Genetics is not a reality under rabbinic law,'' Dr. Cohen said. ''Second, the function of Levites is so minimal it doesn't mean anything.'' Six years ago Dr. Hammer and Dr. Karl Skorecki, of the Technion and Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, looked at the Y chromosomes of both Levites and Cohanim. Both are hereditary priesthoods passed from father to son. They were important in ancient Israel, but sometime between 200 B.C. and A.D. 500 their functions were taken over by rabbis, and Jewish status came to be defined by the biologically more reliable standard of maternal descent. If the patrilineal descent of the two priestly castes had indeed been followed as tradition describes, then all Cohanim should be descended from Aaron, the brother of Moses, and all Levites from Levi, the third son of the patriarch Jacob. Dr. Hammer and Dr. Skorecki found that more than half the Cohanim, in both the Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities, did indeed carry the same genetic signature on their Y chromosome. Their ancestor lived some 3,000 years ago, based on genetic calculations, and may indeed have been Aaron, Dr. Skorecki said.\n",

Dealers described the market's mood as indecisive. Some dealers said a pause was normal after two sessions of sharp advances, but others described the market as confused and contended that the recent price gains had left the market vulnerable to any determined selling. Few professional traders and speculators, who provide much of the bond market's liquidity, have sold Treasury securities short, and that makes the market vulnerable by reducing a potential reservoir of buying power - those who sell securities short eventually have to buy out of their positions. The Treasury's bellwether long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in 2020, were offered late in the day at 103 22/32, off 2/32. This caused the long bond's yield to inch up a basis point, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 8.41 percent. ''It is surprising that the long end of the Treasury bond market held up as well as it did today, given the day's burden of negative news,'' said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. ''The shorter Treasury maturities, which are more influenced by the overnight interbank lending rate as well as Federal Reserve operations, showed the best gains.'' Chicago Purchasing Managers Mr. Kellner noted that about the only positive news for the bond market, which generally reacts positively to bearish economic news, was a report by the Chicago purchasing managers indicating that business was terrible in July. The influential report by the National Association of Purchasing Managers is due out today and is expected to mirror the Chicago data. The reason negative economic news is positive for investors in fixed-income securities is that it is perceived to lessen inflationary pressures and keep interest rates on competitive investment instruments from rising. An important element of the day's economic news - a further drop in the dollar's value against key foreign currencies - was decidedly bearish for the fixed-income market because it made dollar-denominated investments less attractive to foreigners. Single-Family Home Sales Up Also negative was the Government's report of an unexpectedly strong rise of 8 percent in June sales of single-family homes. Moreover, May sales were revised upward to 2.3 percent from a previously reported increase of four-tenths of 1 percent.\n",

Brought to him by a recent emigre from the old Soviet Union, the documents contained the names of 10,000 people who were buried at the Jewish cemetery in Lviv, Ukraine, in the months after Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. For the most part, they were Jews killed under Nazi occupation, either by invading soldiers or local collaborators. It seemed to be important new information, Mr. Krakowski said, but he acknowledged that evaluating it might take a while. \"Nobody can tell right now who they all were,\" he said. This sort of material has been falling his way with fair regularity over the last few years, a dramatic side benefit of the end of Communist authority across Eastern Europe and the breakup of the Soviet Union.  A Wealth of Detail Some of the 350,000 people from the Soviet lands who have emigrated to Israel since 1989 have brought with them Holocaust-related documents, memoirs and letters. But far more significant as information sources are once-secret archives that have been pried open in Poland, Hungary, the former East Germany and, most important, the former Soviet republics. The Soviet files are numerous and comprehensive, and they suggest that the systematic killing of Eastern Europe's Jews was broader than previously realized. \"Our understanding of the dynamics of the 'final solution' will not be changed in a drastic manner by this new information,\" said Efraim Zuroff, director of the office in Israel of the Simon Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles. \"But we are learning a lot about the details of how it was done.\" From what he has seen, says Mr. Krakowski -- himself a survivor of the Lodz ghetto in Poland as well as Auschwitz and Buchenwald -- the generally accepted figure of six million as the number of Jews who were put to death may be on the low side. He would raise the total by 250,000, although he acknowledges that his estimate, for now, lacks scholarly certification. Goldmine of Soviet Files\n",

      "I0729 08:11:49.312154 139789116512064 decoding.py:152] Inference results INPUT: The Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Tuesday that a new federal law requiring prison officials to meet inmates' religious needs is a permissible accommodation of religion that does not violate the separation of church and state. The court rejected arguments by Ohio officials that the law, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, violated the Constitution by elevating religion above all other reasons a prisoner might seek special privileges. The state had said that by requiring prison officials to cater to the demands of adherents of Satanist or white-supremacist religions, the law would result in attracting new followers to these sects, to the detriment of prison security. The five Ohio inmates who brought the case belong to nonmainstream religions, including one, Asatru, that preaches that the white race needs to use violence and terrorism to prevail over the ''mud races.'' In her opinion for the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the state's fears were unfounded. The Congressional sponsors ''were mindful of the urgency of discipline, order, safety, and security in penal institutions,'' she said, and ''we do not read'' the law to ''elevate accommodation of religious observances over an institution's need to maintain order and safety.'' Justice Ginsburg said that under Ohio's constitutional argument, which the federal appeals court in Cincinnati accepted last year in invalidating the statute, ''all manner of religious accommodations would fall.'' She noted that many accommodations have been widely accepted: Ohio itself provides prison chaplains for ''traditionally recognized'' religions, and Congress has authorized military personnel to wear yarmulkes and other religious apparel while in uniform despite a Supreme Court ruling that such an accommodation was not constitutionally required. The Supreme Court has had a sometimes troubled history of defining where the two religion clauses of the First Amendment overlap: the Free Exercise Clause, which protects religious practice from government interference, and the Establishment Clause, which in Justice Ginsburg's words ''commands a separation of church and state.'' From the tone of this latest decision, Cutter v. Wilkinson, No. 03-9877, it appeared that the court was seeking to defuse the tension inherent in the two clauses. ''Our decisions recognize that there is room for play in the joints between the clauses, some space for legislative action neither compelled by the Free Exercise Clause nor prohibited by the Establishment Clause,'' Justice Ginsburg said. The ruling marked the latest chapter in a 15-year dialogue among the court, Congress and the states over the degree to which the government may take religious interests into account in law or official policy. The statute in question, passed in 2000, is a direct outgrowth of that dialogue, which began with a 1990 Supreme Court case from Oregon, Employment Division v. Smith. The court ruled in that case, about American Indians' religious use of an illegal substance, peyote, that the government's refusal to grant religion-based exemptions to the general application of its laws did not violate the Free Exercise Clause.\n",

The first president with an M.B.A. to his name, from Harvard Business School no less, would be the chairman of the board of the world's biggest conglomerate, his aides boasted, a leader who delegated to his cabinet of experienced C.E.O.'s. They said his administration would apply business discipline to a bloated government.  And cabinet sessions do look a lot like the Business Roundtable, the organization of chief executives that, a few weeks ago, held part of its annual meeting in the East Room. Next to the president sits Dick Cheney, late of Halliburton, and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, fresh from Alcoa. Donald H. Rumsfeld is also at the table, in his second run as defense secretary, after running G. D. Searle & Company. Lower level officials, too, look and sound like business folk. ''We effectively are the C.E.O.'s of wholly owned subsidiaries of the Department of Defense,'' said Thomas E. White, who left Enron -- the Texas energy company that wields great influence here -- to become secretary of the army last month. But cracks are already beginning to mar the smooth veneer of Bush & Co.'s boardroom table. Part of the problem is Mr. Bush himself: He cast himself first as a Reagan-style figure -- though less detached -- who would define the missions his team would carry out. But on a host of issues, from energy, to stem cell research, to ending bombing exercises on the island of Vieques in Puerto Rico, Mr. Bush has second-guessed his C.E.O.'s and swept decisions back into the White House. At Bush & Co., the strategic plans are beginning to collide, and polls suggest that  shareholders are increasingly unconvinced by aspects of the business plan. One cause of the president's troubles may be that his C.E.O. approach to running the government conspicuously lacks what Washington demands: the flexibility required to appeal to a variety of constituencies and to horse trade (something Mr. Bush did quite well in Texas). While Mr. Bush scored a quick, major victory with the tax cut, for example, his  energy initiatives and his ''faith-based'' plan for federal aid to religious groups that perform social services have run into the kind of political cross-currents that are rarely seen in corporate America. IN both cases, the White House has shown little willingness to compromise and little ability to persuade voters to share its views. ''They run the meetings on time but he doesn't have much emotional range in connecting these themes to the public,'' said Rahm Emanuel, a highly partisan aide to President Clinton, who never ran meetings on time but knew how to stir a crowd. Mr. Bush's style has also vexed America's allies. They made it clear during his trip to Europe that they are tired of being treated like foreign subsidiaries of America, Inc. So Mr. Bush listened, and said he was humbled. But as soon as he got home, he boasted to The Wall Street Journal that 15 leaders of the European Union ''told me how wrong I was'' on global warming, but that he stood his ground because his position was ''right for America.''\n",

(In New York, Channel 13 will start the series next Sunday at 6 P.M.) And it may explain a procession of efforts by PBS and its affiliated stations to treat questions of morality and religious faith with the same skill  and sophistication they bring to dance, drama, history and politics. This is a particularly appropriate service in a year in which election campaigns are indicating just how important religion is to the American people. In the spring, Bill Moyers used a series of conversations with Huston Smith,  the pioneer scholar of comparative religion, to explore Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism and Islam as well as Judaism and Christianity. In the fall, the indefatigable Mr. Moyers will oversee \"Genesis: A Living Conversation,\" an unusual venture into reading the Bible in the company of not only theologians and Scripture experts but also novelists, musicians, psychotherapists, lawyers and corporate managers. Also promised for the fall is \"With God on Our Side,\" a six-part history of the conservative Christian resurgence that has produced the Moral Majority, the  Christian Coalition and a broader campaign to buoy up traditional values. And Channel 13 has announced plans for a weekly half-hour news program on religion and ethics that will begin in the fall of 1997. None of this surprises Mr. Hewitt, whose own foray into broadcasting on religion was based on what, for television, is the most irrefutable of realities: ratings. \"Always when we did a show on religion or spirituality, the  ratings were better and the response was more intense,\" said Mr. Hewitt, referring to his five years of doing a talk show on a Los Angeles commercial radio station and his four years at KCET. Overnight ratings for \"Life and Times,\" his KCET program, more than doubled,  he said, when the guest was Robert Funk, the founder of the Jesus Seminar, a group of biblical scholars who have been critical of Christianity's traditional  understanding of Jesus of Nazareth. \"The desire of people to learn and have serious conversation about religion was enormous,\" Mr. Hewitt said. And that is exactly what he set out to provide in \"Searching for God in America.\" The basic question, he said, was whether American viewers, with their notoriously short attention span, would tolerate 24 minutes of talk about, say,  Islamic or Mormon theology. His experience had persuaded him that an intelligent layman could make religious subjects accessible, \"letting people witness to their beliefs and explain them,\" without proselytizing, Mr. Hewitt said. \"No one can confuse this with sectarian television,\" he added. \"I want to show that this is not an offensive exercise but one that people of all faiths can enjoy and profit from.\" THE NEXT PROBLEM WAS HOW to address the diversity of American belief systems  in only eight interviews. Half of the subjects are mainstream Christian figures. Charles Colson, the Nixon aide who went to prison after Watergate, and Dr. Roberta Hestenes, the president of Baptist-affiliated Eastern College in St. David's, Pa., represent evangelical Protestantism. The Rev. Cecil Murray, senior pastor of First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, reflects an emphasis on the social aspects of the Gospel. The Rev. Thomas Keating, a Roman Catholic priest and Trappist monk, leads a contemplative-prayer movement.\n",

The exchange filed its lawsuit in Federal District Court in Trenton against the state's Department of Environmental Protection and its Commissioner, Robert C. Shinn Jr. Adding oxygen to fuel helps it burn more efficiently and creates less pollution, especially in the winter. But the fuel with extra oxygen costs more, and consumers have complained. In accordance with the Clean Air Act, New Jersey has been requiring the sale of unleaded gasoline that has a minimum oxygen content of 2.7 percent for at least four months a year. But last month senior officials from the state's Department of Environmental Protection said they intended to terminate the winter program and replace it with a year-round program requiring a minimum oxygen content of 2.0 percent. The mercantile exchange, the world's largest energy market, offers futures contracts for unleaded gasoline based on delivery in the New York Harbor area, including parts of New Jersey. The exchange, commonly known as Nymex, said it was going to court \"as a service to its members, the oil industry and consumers, all of whom will suffer as a result of the impact on a currently efficient marketplace this action and the lack of certainty as whether it will stand will have.\" R. Patrick Thompson, president of the exchange, said: \"We are not taking an environmental position here. But we are talking about the need for New Jersey to put into place legal terms and conditions the marketplace can rely upon. In this case, New Jersey is arbitrarily violating the law.\" Since the use of oxygenated gasoline was begun in November 1992, Nymex contracts during the cold-weather months have conformed to the oxygenated fuel specifications. Mr. Shinn, the Environmental Commissioner, declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying only that the exchange's action is \"premature.\" In a prepared statement, he confirmed that New Jersey wants to end the special winter fuel program.\n",

The space is cascading onto the market as more and more troubled companies scramble to find alternative users for space they leased in the boom years but no longer need or cannot afford to carry. \"If you're a tenant who can easily fit into someone else's used shoes, it's an extraordinary moment,\" said Eric Ossorio, a broker with the midtown Manhattan office of Cushman & Wakefield, the national commercial brokerage company. The average asking price for a sublease in midtown Manhattan dropped to $30.78 a square foot in the first quarter of the year -- substantially below the $37.65 average landlords were quoting for prime leases in the same sort of space, according to the brokerage. But even the landlords are having to make concessions to remain competitive in a glutted market. George Rossi, for instance, assistant director of the World Trade Center, who is responsible for leasing its 10 million square feet, said that in the last 18 months the complex has had to liberalize the terms under which prime tenants may sublet their space. Formerly, the rents had been very tightly restricted to the rates being charged on direct leases. The deals are so attractive that the amount of sublet space available has even begun to drop. In midtown it now stands at 6.8 million square feet, down from 7.3 million in April 1991, according to Cushman & Wakefield. The sublets are proving particularly attractive to smaller users or start-up companies needing less than 10,000 square feet. Such tenants normally have the hardest time getting a good break from a landlord because of their limited bargaining power. Sublets also lower legal costs because the only issue requiring negotiation is normally the price. \"Everything else has to stay as it was,\" said Mr. Ossorio. In addition, said Mitchell Steir, senior managing director with Julien J. Studley, a Manhattan brokerage, subleases \"become very appealing for a start-up firm that's uncertain about its own future.\" Sublets range in length from three to seven years, compared with the traditional five or 10 years for a regular lease. Further, some sublets can provide space that is ready to use, including even desks and telephones.\r\n",

      "I0729 08:11:49.333332 139789116512064 decoding.py:152] Inference results INPUT: Representative Henry A. Waxman asserted on the House floor today that Philip Morris manipulated nicotine levels in at least two cigarette brands. The accusation put pressure on the Clinton Administration to endorse a proposal by the Food and Drug Administration that nicotine must be regulated as a drug, Mr. Waxman's assertion could also seriously compromise Philip Morris's position in its $10 billion lawsuit against ABC. Philip Morris Companies sued ABC after the network made a similar statement about manipulation in its Day One news program early last year. The company has long denied that it sets or manipulates the level of nicotine in cigarettes. But last month, when 2,000 pages of its internal documents were made public, it acknowledged it had manipulated nicotine in test cigarettes. Company officials said the research was never used in making commercial cigarettes. By late today, Philip Morris had not responded to requests for comment on Mr. Waxman's allegations. Mr. Waxman said that in light of Philip Morris's documents and an independent scientific analysis of some of its cigarettes on the market \"there appears to be only one conclusion that can be drawn from this evidence: Philip Morris deliberately increased nicotine levels in commercially marketed cigarettes.\" Last Monday, Mr. Waxman also took the floor to read what he called secret, internal tobacco industry documents into the Congressional Record. He read papers showing that Philip Morris studied hyperactive schoolchildren as potentially \"natural smokers\" and described experiments in which college students were injected with nicotine. Today, he read papers showing that Philip Morris scientists discovered several ways to manipulate the nicotine in cigarettes to give smokers their \"optimal\" desired doses.  Company researchers wrote that they had found an \"optimum\" level of nicotine to satisfy smokers, which they said was the level at which smokers both satisfied the brain's craving for nicotine and gave smokers the mild high they expected from a cigarette. Company officials have acknowledged that researchers did these studies but said the research work was never put into practice and was never used to change the natural level of nicotine in cigarettes. But today Mr. Waxman described an analysis that he said showed that at least two Philip Morris cigarette brands -- Benson and Hedges and King Size Merit Ultra Light -- did have altered nicotine levels. He said that an analysis by a scientist from the University of Pennsylvania showed that the likelihood of the variations occurring by chance or by natural means was less than 1 in 100,000. Mr. Waxman said, \"There is compelling evidence that not long after completing this research, Philip Morris used the research findings to manipulate nicotine levels in cigarette brands sold to the American public.\"\r\n",

      "I0729 08:11:49.338150 139789116512064 decoding.py:152] Inference results INPUT: In a case closely watched in legal circles nationwide, a Florida judge ruled today that a lawyer does not have to disclose the identity of a client who may have killed a man in a hit-and-run accident two years ago. Without the lawyer's cooperation, prosecutors have been unable to identify a suspect and file criminal charges. The decision, which is facing what is likely to be a long appeals fight, comes in an unusual case that tests the limits of the confidentiality of lawyer-client relationships and that has put legal scholars at odds. ''If ever there was a case that tests the privilege of the lawyer-client relationship, this is it,'' said Prof. Andrew L. Kaufman, associate dean of the Harvard University Law School. Experts said courts in different states have been at odds over what a lawyer is obligated to disclose about a client. Indiana's highest court has ruled in a case similar to the one decided today in Florida that a lawyer could not conceal his client's name. The Federal courts have also tended to require lawyers to disclose information in some cases. In California, by contrast, a court held that a lawyer did not have to disclose who had paid his fees. And courts in New York have ruled that a lawyer could not be compelled to disclose evidence that could have linked his client to two murder victims. The Florida case stems from the killing of a 28-year-old electrician, Mark Baltes, who was struck by an automobile and dragged 60 feet on March 9, 1986, as he walked down a road in Palm Beach County at night. Tests later showed Mr. Baltes's blood had an alcohol content of 0.26 percent; 0.10 percent is the threshold for legal intoxication. More than a day after the accident, an unidentified person went to see a lawyer, Barry Krischer, and said he might have been involved in the accident. Mr. Krischer said that the person asked him to negotiate a resolution without disclosing his name to the authorities. Law-enforcement officials refused. The authorities were unable to identify a suspect but were able to determine from paint chips at the crime scene that the car was probably a white 1984 or 1985 Buick Riviera. Mr. Baltes's parents, Mildred and Joseph Baltes, filed a $6 million damage suit against an unspecified defendant, Doe I, and sought to compel Mr. Krischer to disclose the name. Today, Judge Timothy Poulton of the State Circuit Court in West Palm Beach, ruled that the name was protected by state statutes holding that communications between a lawyer and his client are confidential. Any other decision, he wrote, would discourage individuals from confiding in their lawyers or from seeking legal counsel at all. ''If we fail to rule as we do in this case,'' Judge Poulton wrote, ''the result would be the erection of a wall between the public and attorneys.'' National Interest in Case With the case drawing national attention and prompting an outcry in the Palm Beach area, where many residents complain that a criminal is being shielded, the judge was almost apologetic in his decision. ''Plaintiffs' case has tremendous emotional appeal,'' he wrote. ''It is difficult to rule against plaintiffs, but I am convinced that the law requires it.''\r\n",

This week, their concerns will get a public hearing as Congress takes up the question of whether to resurrect the tribunals struck down by the Supreme Court. ''We're at a crossroads now,'' said John D. Hutson, a retired rear admiral who was the top uniformed lawyer in the Navy until 2000 and who has been part of a cadre of retired senior military lawyers who have filed briefs challenging the administration's legal approach. ''We can finally get on the right side of the law and have a system that will pass Supreme Court and international scrutiny.'' Admiral Hutson, one of several current and former senior military lawyers who will testify this week before one of the three Congressional committees looking into the matter, plans to urge Congress to avoid trying to get around last month's Supreme Court ruling. Beginning shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the military lawyers warned that the administration's plan for military commissions put the United States on the wrong side of the law and of international standards. Most important, they warned, the arrangements could endanger members of the American military who might someday be captured by an enemy and treated like the detainees at Guantánamo. But the lawyers' sense of vindication at the Supreme Court's 5-to-3 decision is tempered by growing anxiety over what may happen next. Several military lawyers, most of them retired, have said they are troubled by the possibility that Congress may restore the kind of system they have long argued against. Donald J. Guter, another retired admiral who succeeded Admiral Hutson as the Navy's top uniformed lawyer, said it would be a mistake for Congress to try to undo the Supreme Court ruling. Admiral Guter was one of several senior military judge advocates general, known as JAG's, who after objecting to the planned military commissions found their advice pointedly unheeded. ''This was the concern all along of the JAG's,'' Admiral Guter said. ''It's a matter of defending what we always thought was the rule of law and proper behavior for civilized nations.'' One of the more intriguing hearings will be held Thursday as the current top military lawyers in the Navy, Army, Air Force and Marines testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The main issue at stake will be whether they express the same concerns of those out of uniform who have been critical of the administration's approach. Longstanding custom allows serving officers to give their own views at Congressional hearings if specifically asked, and some in the Senate expect the current uniformed lawyers to generally urge that Congress not stray far from the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the system that details court-martial proceedings. Senator Bill Frist, the Republican leader, told reporters on Monday that he did not expect the Senate to take up any legislation on the issue until at least after the August recess of Congress.\r\n",

      "I0729 08:11:49.346743 139789116512064 decoding.py:152] Inference results INPUT: Two studies being published today suggest that flaws in the treatment of kidney failure may endanger thousands of Americans. Both concern dialysis, the treatment given several times a week to cleanse the blood of waste products that build up when the kidneys do not work. The first report, by researchers at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Medical School, found that people with kidney failure who had dialysis at for-profit treatment centers were 20 percent more likely to die and 26 percent less likely to be referred for a transplant than patients treated at nonprofit centers. Two-thirds of the 200,000 Americans on dialysis are treated at for-profit centers, which have come to dominate the dialysis industry in the last 25 years. The researchers said they did not know the reasons for the disparities, but speculated that for-profit centers might be cutting corners in ways that harmed patients, and failing to recommend transplants in order to hang on to customers and keep dialysis payments coming in. The second study, also by Harvard researchers, found that blacks with kidney failure were considerably less likely than whites to be referred for the best treatment, a transplant -- a difference that could not be explained by medical differences between blacks and whites or on blacks' wanting transplants less than whites. More likely, the authors said, the difference was in doctors' failure to inform blacks properly about the advantages of the surgery. Both studies are being published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. The first, directed by Dr. Pushkal P. Garg, an instructor in medicine and health care policy at Harvard Medical School, included 3,569 patients who began dialysis in 1990 or 1993, and studied them for three to six years; 2,168 were treated at for-profit dialysis centers. The researchers found that for every 100 patients treated a year, 21.2 died at for-profit centers, as against 17.1 at nonprofit centers -- a 20 percent higher risk of death. The study also found that patients at those centers were 26 percent less likely to be referred to transplant centers and placed on waiting lists. Dr. Garg and his colleagues suggested that the root of the problem was the Medicare program, which pays for dialysis for all patients but has not raised the price it pays since 1973. The shrinking value of the payments, they said, might have led centers needing to show a profit to skimp on patient care. Other experts viewed Dr. Garg's findings with caution, and several noted that earlier studies had examined similar data and found no difference in death or transplant referral rates between for-profit and nonprofit centers. The National Kidney Foundation, a patient advocacy group that receives some of its financing from dialysis centers, issued a statement saying that Dr. Garg's data was several years old and that treatment of dialysis patients had improved in the meantime.\r\n",

The neutral-site games were provided for in the settlement of last April's 10-day strike by N.H.L. players. Each team will play two apiece as the league tests new markets for possible expansion. Over the next several days, league executives will meet in Florida to debate and vote on several major issues, including a plan to interrupt the regular season for three weeks in February of 1994 to allow the league's best players to play for their countries on what would amount to a number of Olympic Dream Teams. In addition, the N.H.L.'s Board of Governors is expected to render its long-anticipated decision on harsher penalties for fighting, a move that could alter the public perception of the sport and help in its marketing. At the end of the month, the league will hold a symposium in Toronto at which critics of its drug-abuse policy and parents of newly drafted players will be allowed to voice support for the policy or suggest reforms. The league also hopes to shortly announce a new television contract in the United States that could return the N.H.L., in at least a limited way, to ESPN, the sports network that is widely available on cable. Another possibility being explored is a deal with ABC for the broadcasting of a small number of games. All these items have been pushed in a major way by Gil Stein, who is serving as the league's interim president in place of the departed John Ziegler while team owners search for an executive to fill the newly created office of commissioner. Stein doesn't think the owners need to look any further. With his aggressive approach and progressive agenda, he believes he is the man for the job. A lawyer who served in the background during the Ziegler administration, Stein was asked if he views himself as a candidate. \"I think so,\" Stein replied. \"They know I am. I've told them I am. I expect to be considered.\"\r\n",

Yet, in terms of Canadians' eating habits, the news has been a nonevent. ''Nobody has even asked a question about it,'' Bob Oravec, an owner of Bloor Meat Market, a busy Toronto butcher shop, said Monday afternoon. Such nonchalance has been in evidence ever since Canada's first case of mad cow disease was diagnosed on a ranch in northern Alberta in May. The Beef Information Center, part of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, based in Calgary, estimates that Canada's beef consumption will be 8 percent to 10 percent higher this year than in 2002, making it the only country where demand has increased in the face of a mad cow outbreak. But experts are wondering how consumers here will react now that the infected Holstein cow in Washington has almost certainly been traced back to Canada. The United States Agriculture Department said Monday that records in the United States and Canada confirm that the cow was born north of the border in April 1997. The department and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency are still conducting DNA tests on the cow and its presumed sire and calves. Kevin Grier, an analyst at the George Morris Center, an agri-food research group in Guelph, Ontario, said that new curbs on exports to the United States would probably be a greater concern to the Canadian beef industry than adverse consumer reaction. ''There's enough understanding that we don't eat the products associated with the human variant of mad cow disease,'' Mr. Grier said. But Mr. Grier said that a firm conclusion that the infected cow came from Canada ''won't help.'' Alberta's premier, Ralph Klein, a vocal beef industry supporter, on Monday urged Canadians not to ''jump to any conclusions'' about the origin of the infected American cow. Canada was the world's third-biggest beef exporter, after Australia and the United States, when foreign markets were shut off in May. A business that brought in 4.1 billion Canadian dollars ($3.13 billion) in 2002 earned nothing in the three months after the disease was found. Exports accounted for 60 percent of Canada's beef industry. Since then, the United States and some other countries have partially reopened their borders to Canadian beef. The United States Agriculture Department is weighing a further relaxation that would allow the importation from Canada of live cattle under 30 months old, though ranchers in the United States have asked the department to reconsider.\r\n",

Mr. Malick, a former journalist and philosophy professor, burst into the film business in 1973 with his stark and moody drama ''Badlands,'' which helped propel the careers of Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek. He followed that in 1978 with ''Days of Heaven,'' a tortured tale of love in the rural Midwest that won critical praise and helped boost the careers of Richard Gere and Sam Shepard. And that was it. Mr. Malick, who refused an interview and is notoriously press shy, lived in Paris and Texas and abandoned moviemaking. Twenty years later, he is back. He has written and directed a $50 million production of ''The Thin Red Line,'' based on the James Jones novel about fighting in the South Pacific in World War II. And once again he has chosen little-known actors to help lead an ensemble in the film, being produced by Phoenix Pictures and Fox 2000 Pictures and scheduled for release near Christmas. A number of top actors were eager to work with Mr. Malick on the movie, which is about an Army rifle company trying to take a hill on Guadalcanal from the Japanese. George Clooney, John Cusack, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Travolta, Woody Harrelson and Bill Pullman all play roles. But as he did in his previous movies, Mr. Malick chose relative unknowns for two of the most demanding parts. Adrien Brody (above), 24, a New Yorker with television and independent movie credits, plays Fife, and Jim Caviezel, 29, a soft-spoken newcomer from rural Washington state, plays Witt. Mr. Caviezel said he was hoping to become a professional basketball player until he realized that he did not quite have the speed or size needed. He drifted into acting, and his quiet strength -- Mike Medavoy, chairman of Phoenix Pictures, compared him to Henry Fonda -- helped him land modest roles in ''Wyatt Earp,'' with Kevin Costner, and ''G.I. Jane.'' He said that when Mr. Malick called to invite him to work on the movie, he was stunned. ''No director had ever called me at home,'' he said, adding that Mr. Malick was extraordinarily gentle in his prodding of the actors, although he could be a perfectionist and clearly had to restrain his temper on the set. Mr. Brody has a more street-wise, quick-talking, urban personality. He said Mr. Malick was quite unorthodox in his directing at times. ''He would say that his role was to not have you act,'' Mr. Brody said. ''He wanted it to be spontaneous. It was almost as if he was trying to shoot a documentary. But I don't think anybody ever doubted his vision. He was real clear in what he wanted.'' Mr. Brody and Mr. Caviezel both did imitations of Mr. Malick, a habit they said almost all the cast members acquired. They used a slightly high-pitched voice and halting delivery, and both noted Mr. Malick's intense interest in birds. ''We'd be in the middle of a scene, and he'd see something interesting, like a flock of birds,'' Mr. Brody said. ''So he'd shoot the birds for a minute and then we'd get back to the movie.'' The Big Picture The brilliant colors and huge, crystal-clear images of Imax movies have long been a staple of museums. The films, shot in an innovative 70-millimeter format and projected onto large, specially built screens, have impressed audiences with the wonders of science and nature.\r\n",

Ms. Beckham turned up dutifully at runway shows, was seen teetering on the cobblestones of Via della Spiga with her two bodyguards in attendance and managed to unnerve at least one fashion editor when she accosted her in the ladies' room at a party Anna Wintour gave for Amy Astley, the editor of Ms. Wintour's new pet project, Teen Vogue. ''She came up to me at Light,'' said Sasha Charnin Morrison of Allure, referring to the restaurant that is bidding to become Milan's new outpost of culinary hip. (And Milan could use one. At fashion restaurants, the chatter is invariably an improvement on the food.) ''She said she wanted me to know that she hadn't been stalking me at Dolce & Gabbana,'' said Ms. Morrison, who had indeed noticed Ms. Beckham's laser attention directed at her while waiting for the show to start. ''She had her eye on my bag,'' Ms. Morrison explained. ''I don't know if she expected me to give it to her.'' This may seem unlikely given that Ms. Beckham's husband, the soccer deity David Beckham, earns a reported £90,000, or more than $140,000, a day. Still, you never know. Season of the French ''The French editors are working all the new looks,'' remarked Sally Singer, an editor of Vogue, before the Miu Miu show Tuesday. Anchoring a row of French editors on the opposite side of the runway was Carine Roitfeld of French Vogue, a style nonpareil who continues to be a focus of many eyes. ''They've got the leggings,'' Ms. Singer remarked as she diagrammed fashion's immediate future in a way that helps explain why people cross the Atlantic four times a year to come to these things. ''They've got the over-the-knee boot, the pencil skirt, the man's coat that you borrowed from the guy. Now, all you need is a Courrèges minidress and you have the whole fall season. It's mindless, it's easy, you're done.'' Trend-Catching ''I was at a museum, and I just got a click on the armor,'' said Tomas Maier, referring to the ideas behind the new collection of bags and clothes he designed for Bottega Veneta, the venerable leather-goods house, now part of the Gucci Group. Inspiration in fashion is evidently viral. All sorts of designers seemed to click on armor this season, independently yet somehow in unison. Last season it was zippers and, before that, clothing with jewelry attached. Fashion's version of an aluminum-siding salesman must really get around. At Milan Vukmirovic's show for Jil Sander, the reference was found in the jointed articulation of a sleeve. At Karl Lagerfeld's Fendi show, it was coin-dot panels formed of fur pressed beneath plastic and resembling modern-day mail. At Prada, there were oversize gloves that seemed suitable for jousting. And on almost every runway, there was what remained of the hides that once armored the small mammals and swamp creatures to which they first belonged.\r\n",

But it is also a blow to the United States and the International Monetary Fund, which had invested much of their credibility and prestige here, yet proved unwilling to help when things began falling apart. ''I think this is going to end up being a very costly experience for the United States,'' Walter Molano, chief of research for BCP Securities, a brokerage firm based in Connecticut that focuses on Latin America, said today. ''It was very clearly the Department of the Treasury that pushed Argentina over the edge and allowed it to collapse, so I think the issue of accountability has to come up.'' A decade ago, Argentina decided to tie its peso to the dollar at a value of one to one, a decision that at first dramatically reduced inflation and imposed fiscal discipline, but eventually led to the current crisis. The first Bush administration had strongly urged that step on Argentina, and the United States tried to sell the same system to other doubtful Latin American countries. There is plenty of blame to go around. But from the start, the second Bush administration found it convenient to overlook the United States's earlier role as advocate and cheerleader of that policy and to distance itself as much as possible from Argentina's growing problems. The bluntest statement of official indifference came from Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill this summer and helped accelerate the loss of capital and confidence here. ''They've been off and on in trouble for 70 years or more,'' Mr. O'Neill said dismissively in an interview with the British magazine The Economist. ''They don't have any export industry to speak of at all. And they like it that way. Nobody forced them to be what they are.'' What was missing from Mr. O'Neill's analysis, however, was any mention of the high tariffs the United States imposes on Argentine exports or of the aversion to easing those barriers to help Argentina regain its footing. Nor was the Bush administration particularly helpful in ''creating some kind of framework for how the international system could respond, rather than saying, 'It's all up to you,' '' said Peter Hakim, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based conference of hemisphere leaders. As a result, ''the Argentines were operating in a vacuum, without a clear sense of what the United States was thinking and what it was prepared to do to be helpful,'' Mr. Hakim said. ''The real blame is passivity: the U.S. did not want to engage, and so it stayed on the sidelines.'' Taking its cue from the Bush administration, the International Monetary Fund kept ''raising the bar'' on Argentina, in Mr. Molano's words -- requiring increasingly harsh austerity measures -- in return for the disbursement of money already promised. That was followed by the fund's public declaration on Dec. 18 of its lack of confidence in the Argentine authorities, which helped hasten the government's fall. ''It's clear that the mix of fiscal policy, debt and the exchange rate regime is not sustainable,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, the fund's chief economist. He also maintained that ''everyone recognizes that to a large extent the problem lies in Argentina,'' a statement that did not ring true to other governments in the region. ''The fund is partly to blame for this because the fund did not sound the alarm in time and then took a very hard line when things were incredibly difficult,'' said Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, the finance minister of Peru, which has itself been in in talks with the organization recently.\r\n",

      "I0729 08:13:37.003269 139789116512064 decoding.py:152] Inference results INPUT: To the Editor: Your Nov. 15 front-page story on austerity at the State Department and fear for diplomacy touches upon, then misses, much of an important and troublesome national issue. Members of the Foreign Service officer corps, which I was privileged to enter in 1948, expected to spend most of their lives abroad. That Foreign Service had been tempered and tested in a world not yet blessed with instant communication, jet flight and constant visitation by representatives of the executive and legislative establishments in Washington. As I embarked on my 32 years in the Foreign Service, I found it staffed by strong, colorful, even exotic figures, who had moved resolutely to know the people and speak the languages of countries they truly served as representatives of the President and the Secretary of State. While the senior officers I originally knew may have been a vanishing generation, they tended to be respected at home and abroad as true professionals. Over my extended period of active, intense and rewarding service, rules of the game designed to attract, retain and promote the brightest and the best were constantly being altered. Personnel procedures and bureaucracy became an end in themselves. Evaluation procedures and criteria fell from fashion. The old emphasis on survival of the fittest through ''selection up or out'' was progressively distorted and eroded, while a different body of doctrine came into being to defend the unqualified from the consequences of their own shortcomings. On balance, the Foreign Service has been incredibly fortunate to retain so many excellent people. Today's world is one of growing population, ever more nation states, emerging peoples, evolving societies, insistent demands for a new economic order, pressures of development and urbanization, and a whole new complex of North-South as well as East-West challenges and opportunities. To survive and compete in such an environment and to advance United States interests, the key front-line resource is - or should be - a highly professional and ever stronger Foreign Service. Unfortunately, we go on dissipating and wasting our assets. Today's procedures serve many purposes but fall short of appropriate emphasis on preservation and use of true quality. Persistent erosion of Foreign Service ethic, morale and capability are compounded by budgetary austerity, increased politicization of career positions and a self-defeating mechanization of promotion-up and selection-out procedures. The result is enforced displacement and disillusioned departure from the service of the very personnel and talent we have worked to attract and develop over the years in hopes of being able to survive, operate effectively and prevail in the new, larger and more competitive international arena that confronts our nation.

      "I0729 08:13:37.007441 139789116512064 decoding.py:152] Inference results INPUT: DURING his savvy strategy of passivity, Commissioner Gary Bettman could let public apathy do the devil's work for him as the National Hockey League spiraled silently toward its third month of a lockout. He didn't have to belittle his league, not when a poll in The Hockey News revealed that only 56 percent of Americans even knew the N.H.L. had faded to black. He didn't have to rail about the gluttony of players, not when the lunch-pail fan base already blamed the catered-to stars. Bettman could preserve his voice of doom when others were speaking volumes. As the Coyotes' Brett Hull recently told The Arizona Republic, ''I think there's no question that the fans are going to lose interest because the game that's not being played right now wasn't that exciting to begin with.'' As an editorial in The Globe and Mail of Toronto on Nov. 6 explained: ''By locking down major league hockey nearly a month ago, you've shown us something. We can live without it.'' For weeks, this public indifference was Bettman's leverage, with fan silence as his support system. How could the union protect the box-office salaries of its stars when the box office didn't have a line of fans panting to get in? How could the union justify A-list money to a Ranger like Bobby Holik if his celebrity couldn't swing him a table at Nobu? The union boss Bob Goodenow had to do something to undermine Bettman's ability to parlay the N.H.L.'s irrelevance into a negotiating tool. On Thursday, Goodenow stirred up the suffocating dead air by unveiling an offer that rippled with shock value. Salary rollbacks, Goodenow proclaimed. To his credit, it was a monster concession from the union, perking up jaded followers who had wondered if the union possessed an ounce of economic or social awareness. Suddenly, Goodenow had placed players in the same sort of sacrificial roles as the union pilots across the United States who had absorbed pay cuts to keep airlines flying. And he had turned players into sympathetic symbols instead of examples of excess by putting 24 percent of each goon, rookie and journeyman's salary into the pockets of beleaguered owners. ''Let me be clear on this,'' Goodenow said. ''This is no grandstanding ploy. This is no P.R. move.'' This denial was glorious, one dripping with grandstanding moves and this simple P.R. ploy: rouse the dormant fan base while putting the pressure on Bettman to counter with a good-faith proposal when bargaining resumes Tuesday. It's a smooth move by Goodenow on the surface because his celebrated plan begs for attention but does not address the one systemic issue Bettman covets most: cost certainty, as in a potential salary cap.\r\n",

      "I0729 08:13:37.012467 139789116512064 decoding.py:152] Inference results INPUT: Since the Supreme Court in the 1930's first tried to cripple and then affirm the Federal Government's far-reaching power over interstate commerce, constitutional scholars have mostly assumed that Federal primacy was a settled issue in our political system. Not so, as the Court's current term shows. In terms of power, the most important case before the Justices now is not the claim of a constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, profound though that is in human terms. It is not Paula Jones's lawsuit against President Clinton, despite the prurient interest that it arouses (and that the Court will not satisfy). It is the challenge to the Brady handgun control law. The immediate question is whether state and local officials -- sheriffs, police chiefs -- can be required by Federal law to carry out background checks on purchases of handguns. But there are larger implications for American federalism and where today's Supreme Court is taking it. Two years ago the Court shattered assumptions when it held, in the Lopez case, that a Federal law making it a crime to have an unlicensed gun in a school zone was unconstitutional. Incompetent Congressional draftsmen had failed to specify that the gun must involve interstate commerce, and for the first time in half a century the Court found that Congress had gone beyond Federal commerce power. Last year Congress moved to overcome the Lopez decision. It re-enacted the law against guns in school zones, this time tying it explicitly to interstate commerce and other national interests. The new law begins with a lengthy recitation of Congressional findings -- that guns and ammunition move in interstate commerce, that crime is a pervasive national problem, that interstate travel is inhibited by fear of crime and so on. The elaborate findings read like something New Deal lawyers might have produced to overcome the resistance of the conservative Justices known then as the Four Horsemen. That in itself is a sign of how an earlier day's legal concerns have re-emerged. Suits challenging the Brady law, financed in good part by the National Rifle Association, have not attacked Congress's right to act under its commerce power. They assert, rather, that the Federal Government may not ''commandeer'' state and local processes to serve a Federal function. To do so, they argue, violates the 10th Amendment, which says that powers not delegated to the Federal Government by the Constitution remain with the states or people. The word ''commandeer,'' taken from another recent Supreme Court decision, sounds unfair and dictatorial. But in fact all kinds of Federal laws direct state and local officials to help in enforcement. State agencies are required to withhold Federal income and Social Security taxes from their employees, for example. Last year's immigration law requires states to confirm the lawful immigration status of any person given medical services if the state wants a Federal reimbursement. The groups attacking the Brady law say the other examples of federally mandated actions by state and local officials are different because the laws involved were passed under Congress's broad power to tax and spend for national purposes. Congress can always condition spending -- reimbursement of state health or welfare costs, for instance -- on compliance with Federal rules. But that argument seems to me to reflect an empty formalism. It is the kind of formalism that we thought the Supreme Court had abandoned after its failed effort to stop national emergency measures against the Great Depression in the 1930's.\r\n",

Last night, moments after the Senate had voted, the president of the L.I.R.R., Bruce C. McIver, said that he hoped to restore service by Friday but he was unsure whether service could be resumed in time for the morning rush. However, Mr. McIver said, much would depend on when the 6,600 workers return to their jobs. ''Undoubtedly, it will be a little ragged until Monday,'' he said. ''But it's better to have it a little rough in the beginning than to have no service at all.'' Workers will have to be found, scheduled and sent to the many locations where the trains are stored. Breathing life into the line, difficult enough after a walkout lasting almost two weeks, is being complicated by two snowstorms and bitter cold. Off to Truck Yards Still, the vice president of operations, Larry Baggerly, has been waiting for the back-to-work signal since the start of the strike Jan. 18. Armed with a three-point plan and 250,000 pounds of rock salt, Mr. Baggerly is charged with getting the line and its 110,000 daily commuters moving. First, Mr. Baggerly said, drivers and maintenance workers will be found and sent in buses to the areas where the line's trucks and and over-the-road vehicles are stored. They will fan out from just east of Pennsylvania Station to Greenpoint and Montauk, essentially to shovel out the railroad. Mr. Baggerly said he hoped that within 8 to 10 hours of the order to resume work he would have up to 1,200 workers in the field, inspecting, cleaning and repairing the 700 miles of track, including 375 miles of third rail; 17 maintenance yards, 1,450 swtiches, 311 grade crossings and 744 crossing gates, not to mention 22 miles, or 30 acres, of platforms and the ramps and bridges at 136 stations. At some sites, there are 16 inches of snow and ice. Fewer than 10 percent of the grade crossings were reported affected by snowplows. Crucial systems governing train speed, track circuits, grade crossings and signals came through the strike and the snows in reasonable shape, according to the L.I.R.R. To keep them in working order, the railroad has been running a handful of patrol trains daily. Cranking Up the Diesels In the next phase of Mr. Baggerly's battle plan, the line's 70 or so diesels, many of which have been stored at the Dunston shop, will be serviced, fueled and started. Dispatchers will round up crews to drive them. Essentially the same procedure will be followed with the fleet of 984 electric cars, most of which have been herded in Jamaica, Far Rockaway, Hempstead and Freeport, where some of the 700 nonunion employees have been cleaning and testing them.\r\n",

After the excitement of pumpkins and Christmas trees, the North Fork looks bleak and abandoned, with bare vines stretching into the distance under chilly gray skies. In high summer, the big wineries may have 10,000 visitors on a busy weekend; in mid-winter, they may get 10. This is the perfect time for a wine-tasting tour. Winemaking is an industry that actually attracts tourists. People don't flock to factories where jogging shoes are made, and they certainly don't want to see what goes into hot dogs or frozen chicken dinners. What's so special about wine? One reason is that unlike other industries, it is beautiful to look at. The wineries don't seem like factories at all, but more like elegant private estates. But the main reason for the popularity with visitors is that they offer free samples (unlike the Chrysler Corporation, or your local French restaurant). I have often wondered how the wineries cope with their flow of eager and (as the day goes on) increasingly merry clients. Wine is a complicated subject, and taste is impossible to describe or predict. How on earth do the vintners manage to get through the tasting day without fistfights, lawsuits and serious collateral damage? The answer is: with superhuman patience and a certain theatrical flair. Charles and Ursula Massoud invited me to observe the drama of the tasting room at their Paumanok Vineyard in Aquebogue. I arrived on a sunny Saturday morning to find the place empty except for two couples all the way from Wayne, N.J. They were full of questions. ''Where do you get the grapes for this?'' ''Why does this chardonnay taste different from the other one?'' ''Why do you call it barrel fermented?'' ''Where does the color come from?'' So I learned my first lesson about working in a tasting room: most questions are easy. If you are lazy, almost every query can be answered by invoking the weather (''It was wet in '96''), the grape variety or the fermentation technique. But every question was carefully answered by Ursula Massoud, who must have heard them all 10,000 times before. ''You have to love this job,'' she explained wryly.\r\n",

Mr. Dole's host was Joseph M. Arpaio, the Sheriff here in Maricopa County. It is Sheriff Arpaio who created this 1,000-bed Estrella Jail Facility -- cots crammed together under tents in a desert where summer temperatures routinely reach 120 degrees -- and who has used it, along with the resulting national media attention, to help burnish an image as the toughest sheriff in America. Today Sheriff Arpaio, a Republican who is also up for election this year, provided Mr. Dole not only an  endorsement but also a visually provocative, even grim, setting to underscore the Presidential nominee's  new attention to the crime issue. On the jail's dusty grounds, Mr. Dole staged one of the most unusual events of his campaign: a discussion with selected supporters -- law-enforcement officials, community-patrol organizers and crime victims -- in a yard behind barbed wire. To reach the spot, Mr. Dole walked past the drab-green tents, their sides drawn up to provide some air on this hot afternoon. Inside, on cots covered with thin mattresses, were prisoners,  some wearing bright-orange jail uniforms, others shirtless. A number of them sat up at the arrival of Mr. Dole and his huge entourage of aides, Secret Service agents and reporters. Mr. Dole walked into the yard to  music from the soundtrack of the movie ''Patriot Games,'' performed by the Irish contemporary folk singer Enya. Once there, he proceeded with another in a series of forums that his campaign calls ''Listening to America.'' He stood against a backdrop of tents, these empty of prisoners, who might have otherwise tried  to disrupt the proceedings with catcalls. Behind him, a lone guard leaned over the railing of a looming tower. After the five-minute tour that had brought him to the yard, Mr. Dole declined to offer an opinion of the tent jail. ''I'm just starting to get a feel for it,'' he said. ''I'm going to look a little longer before I pass judgment.'' Similarly he never specifically addressed the details of Sheriff Arpaio's approach to law enforcement and corrections. These include armed citizen posses to go after drug dealers and prostitutes; chain gangs for male offenders and other chain gangs for female offenders, and a 23-hour-a-day lockdown of prisoners who are unwilling to work. Prisoners are also prohibited from using cigarettes or receiving pornography. Coffee too is barred, because Sheriff Arpaio once calculated that it cost $100,000 a year. And the prisoners are given bologna sandwiches for lunch rather than hot meals. On one occasion, the Sheriff even ordered all the prisoners' underwear died pink, in an effort to halt a rash of undergarment theft from the county jail system. Although Mr. Dole said little about such details, his choosing this as his first stop after a major anti-crime  speech on Monday, and his warm praise for Sheriff Arpaio, made clear that he embraced the general approach. He seemed particularly impressed that the Sheriff, faced with overcrowding at the county's indoor jails, had been able to provide this additional housing, for about 1,000 prisoners, at a construction cost of  $117,000.\r\n",

A $6 million stock offering is planned for September, and construction of the bank's headquarters at Washington and Howard Streets will begin soon. The bank, expected to open later this year, will be in the Hill section of New Haven, an area bounded by Route 34, Boulevard, Church Street, South Street and Long Wharf and with a large Hispanic population. It is also the only area of the city served by a Hispanic alderman. ''The need is double,'' said Gerardo Canto, president of Canto Development Associates and the chairman of Connecticut Popular Bank, the new institution. ''You have a need for the basic financial services provided by a bank, because there are no other financial services in that neighborhood currently, and there's a need for a financial institution that will serve as a source of pride for the Hispanic community. ''The intention is to create a bank that will be controlled by the Hispanic community and act as an instrument to capitalize on its resources.'' Raymond Garcia, a lawyer and one of the bank's organizers, said that while the bank would be owned by a group of Hispanic professionals, it would seek a broad customer base. ''It's going to be a community bank, so we're going to need broad community support,'' Mr. Garcia said. ''It's not at all separatist in nature. It will have to draw a wide spectrum of depositors because we can't make it any other way.'' Marcial Cuevas, executive director of the Community Action Program of New Haven and another of the organizers, said there would be some differences in the new bank, including the use of Spanish-speaking personnel. Although all the bank's policies have not been set, the intention of the organizers is to make financial services available to all people, regardless of income level. ''We're going to have to be a lot less traditional than normal banks,'' Mr. Cuevas said. Tomas Reyes, the Fourth Ward Alderman in New Haven, said that the hiring of Hispanic employees would help the new bank become accepted in the Hill. ''An initial barrier, a real simple one like language, will be eliminated,'' Mr. Reyes said. ''People can feel comfortable about going in to open an account or see a loan officer.''\r\n",

Mr. Clinton said he was grateful for Russia's diplomatic help in defusing the three-week crisis, which began when Iraq barred the American members of a United Nations weapons inspection team on Oct. 29. The entire team then left Iraq, raising fears of a new military confrontation between that country and the United States. Today, the President said he remained wary about the willingness of Iraq's leader, President Saddam Hussein, to abide by the international arms monitoring regime and said a strict inspections program must continue. Mr. Clinton called President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia this morning, and the two leaders spoke for 40 minutes, according to White House officials. Mr. Clinton relayed his opposition to any immediate relaxation of the onerous economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. ''The United States is concerned about the welfare of the people of Iraq,'' Mr. Clinton said in an airport statement on arrival here today for a pair of Democratic fund-raising events. ''We don't want to see them suffer unnecessarily. We took the lead in putting in place a policy in the United Nations that permits us to expand humanitarian assistance there. ''But the most important thing is that those inspectors need to be back at work and they need to work without impediment,'' he said. He cited a report today from the leader of the United Nations inspection team, Richard Butler, that Baghdad continues to block access to suspect sites. Mr. Butler recommended a ''more robust'' inspection regime. ''That is what we need to focus on,'' Mr. Clinton said. He thanked Mr. Yeltsin for Moscow's role as an intermediary this week in persuading Mr. Hussein to readmit the arms inspectors ''at least temporarily.'' Mr. Yeltsin has argued that the inspections have demonstrated Iraqi compliance with demands to end its development of nuclear weapons and medium-range missiles to deliver them, thus justifying a partial lifting of the sanctions. He told Mr. Clinton that Iraqi progress should bring a speedier end to the sanctions, according to a White House official.\r\n",

The pests were said to be gnawing away undetected, doing great damage, until an exterminator brought in Ben the Beagle to sniff them out.

And in his remarkably well written songs, which have improved as he gets deeper into his 40's, he keeps introducing himself by telling you what he likes and what he dislikes. Thumbs up: slow-going living, his country and its armed forces, his favorite bar, the memory of his father, ''freedom'' (a key word in the lexicon) and women whose words are consistent with their actions. Thumbs down: fast and complicated living, most other countries, women who send mixed messages and women who talk too much. You can get 10 albums out of that database without too much trouble. (The 10th, ''Shock 'N Y'all,'' comes out in November.) His voice is what sells the songs like crazy, turning all his albums into hits. It's a modernized version of the stoic, soft but firm baritone Lefty Frizzell introduced in the 1950's. That voice is particularly good on songs with old-fashioned country dynamics. At the PNC Bank Arts Center here tonight he sang his new single, ''I Love This Bar,'' with a steadiness through a dry wit that shows he's studied the masters. ''I like my truck,'' goes one verse. ''I like my girlfriend/ I like to take her out to dinner/ I like a movie now and then/ but I love this bar.'' The greatest country singer-songwriters seem too humble and cavalier to have written the sharpened lines they sing. Mr. Keith, at his best, is in that tradition. But on Saturday he sang few ballads or overly country-sounding songs. Instead he played his high-power material, using his booming vibrato voice, which suggests a less anxious version of Meat Loaf. (In his 10-piece band, steel-guitar lurked low in the mix; electric lead guitar ruled.) He spread his retributive politics thick, invoking his country in between-song asides where it wasn't strictly necessary. (''It's a beautiful thing when you go out on a beautiful night in the United States and hear some music and do some drinkin'.'') He has grasped that an entertainer seldom goes broke by playing Captain America. Toward the end of the show he switched to a stars-and-stripes guitar to play Merle Haggard's ''Fightin' Side of Me,'' a dove-baiting song that fits perfectly in Mr. Keith's repertory, and his own ''Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American),'' easily the most belligerent popular song to have been written after Sept. 11. Fans shouted ''U.S.A.!''; air-cannons shot red, white and blue confetti; giant banners of the armed forces insignia and Uncle Sam were unrolled by the stage. Mr. Keith also realizes that there are smaller but still important gains in presenting yourself as an aesthetic rebel. So, alone with his guitarist Scott Emerick, he performed some of the songs that he said his record company, DreamWorks, found too politically incorrect to include on his albums. (Whether that's true or not, it's a good thing to say.) They were his ''bus songs,'' he said, written on tour for the band's own amusement. One was ''The Taliban Song,'' written from the point of view of an Afghan who resents the Taliban. The other was called ''I'll Never Smoke Weed With Willie Again,'' marveling at the strength of Willie Nelson's pot. That one was relieving, in a way: it reminded you that Mr. Keith, despite all his demagoguery, is just a musician. COUNTRY MUSIC REVIEW\r\n",

      "I0729 08:13:37.048049 139789116512064 decoding.py:152] Inference results INPUT: In a world that supposedly increasingly celebrates diversity, there is one constant and obvious personal trait that marks complete social unacceptability: obesity. Unlike any other physical attribute that differs from the ideal norm, being overweight is an immediate flashing light that connotes reduced desirability. You never know right away if the person you're dating is a potential Son of Sam or Lizzie Borden. But if you spot flabby arms, that's a dead giveaway for lack of self-esteem and fear of intimacy. Those of us who grew up overweight belong to an elite club. We've learned the social grace of smiling when friends at least 30 pounds lighter than us whine, ''I'm so fat!'' Our measurements mean that we shop alone so we can unashamedly find double-digit-size clothing that fits. We don't expect that anyone remotely resembling us will play a romantic lead in a major motion picture. An overweight person can be cast as eccentrically funny or play a tortured character, but will never be the ultimate love interest. In high school, I saw my first diet doctor, an Upper East Side physician who dispensed multicolored pills to be downed with breakfast, lunch and dinner. The drug's only long-lasting effect was that by my senior year, I could recite the causes of the Spanish-American War in breathtakingly record time. Since then I have become a ''yo-yo'' dieting champion. I've tried liquid protein diets, no-fat regimes, all-fat-no-sugar regimes, Redux before it was returned to sender -- and a highly questionable detour with a quack who offered breathing lessons. He advised his patients not to bite into that fried chicken and instead inhale deeply and think of him. But now the Federal Government has formally announced that the battle of the bulge is no longer being fought by a floundering lipid minority. More than half of Americans are now considered overweight, according to new guidelines that use body mass index, a calculation of body weight in relation to height. Now anyone with a body mass index as low as 25 -- 5-foot-4, 145 pounds or 5-foot-10, 174 pounds -- would be considered overweight. A 6-foot person who weighed 221 pounds would be obese. Does this now mean that most Americans will learn to blame their spouse's inattention, their office mate's promotion and all their emotions on an unfortunate preference for muffins at breakfast instead of Special K? Will half the country train themselves to wear long sleeves even on the hottest days of the year? Or now that we overweight are a clear majority, will models with thighs wider than the circumference of a Bic pen make up more than half the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue? Will over half the country dream the impossible dream that their lives would completely change if only they lost 20 pounds? On a positive note, this new definition of the overweight might give us individual members of the coalescing coalition a renewed sense of community. The playwright Herb Gardner refers to assimilated Jews as ''The Hidden Yidden.'' The Government has outed ''The Hidden Lipin.'' However, the new guidelines also mean that more people than we thought are at increased risk of heart disease and cancer. This is not the kind of inclusive community we've been searching for. Those of us who won't be wearing Lycra slips to our next Oscar party are not lobbying for more people to have diabetes and heart disease. Perhaps the best result of the Government's guidelines would be a truly diverse society, where weight for more than half the population becomes a medical issue and not a financial, emotional and social one. Lipidity does matter, but not for the reasons we've so blatantly ascribed to it.\r\n",

      "I0729 08:13:37.052319 139789116512064 decoding.py:152] Inference results INPUT: Contradicting claims by the United States Army, Israeli officials say that Patriot missiles deployed to defend Israel from attacks by Iraqi Scud missile attacks in the Persian Gulf war intercepted next to none of the Scuds. The United States Army has said that its Patriots intercepted about 40 percent of the Scud missiles that Iraq fired at Israel during the war in 1991. That is a far more modest estimate than the one originally given by the military and by the Bush Administration. In the gulf war, former President George Bush once said that the Patriot's record was nearly perfect. But Moshe Arens, who was Israel's Defense Minister in the gulf war; Gen. Dan Shomron, who was chief of staff of the Israel Defense Force during the war, and Haim Asa, a member of an Israeli technical team that worked with the Patriot missile during the war, say that one or possiblly none of the Scuds was intercepted by the Patriots. They appeared in a documentary scheduled to be aired today on Israel television. An advance copy of interviews with the three was made available to The New York Times. In the documentary, General Shomron described accounts of the Patriot's success as \"a myth;\" Mr. Asa called them \"a joke.\" Mr. Arens, asked how many Scuds were intercepted by Patriots, said that \"the number is minuscule and is in fact meaningless.\" All concurred with a 1991 report by the Israeli Air Force concluding that \"there is no evidence of even a single successful intercept\" although there is \"circumstantial evidence for one possible intercept.\" Several nations are interested in acquiring missile defense systems like the Patriot. Israel is developing a competing system, the Arrow, with assistance from the United States; General Shomron heads the state-owned weapons complex. Asked about the striking discrepancy between United States and Israeli accounts of the Patriot's performance, Mr. Arens said, \"I can understand if somebody wants to sell his product.\" In interviews, senior executives of Raytheon Co. of Lexington, Mass., the builder of the Patriot, said that differences over what constituted an \"intercept\" accounted for the discrepancy. \"The numbers of Scuds successfully intercepted are small in any case and very small changes in criteria can swing the results from one extreme to another,\" said Robert M. Stein, a Raytheon vice president. By the Army's definition, an intercept is not just a direct hit by a Patriot. It includes detonations that divert tumbling, disintegrating Scud missiles from their presumed targets. The Patriot system deployed during the gulf war was an anti-aircraft system built to defend a military base, not to defend a sprawling city from missiles. Technicians from the Israel armed forces and Raytheon frantically rewrote its software as the Scuds rained down, said Stephen R. Stanvick, a Raytheon missile systems manager.\r\n",
