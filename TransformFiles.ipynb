In the last year many states have expanded Medicaid eligibility or increased benefits to provide more assistance to pregnant women and children from low-income families.', 'In each state, the Federal Government pays at least half the costs of Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal-state welfare program. Giant Share of U.S. Spending', 'Benefit programs account for nearly half of all Federal spending. In August the budget office estimated that the cost of these programs would rise from $467 billion in the current fiscal year, 1987, to $499 billion in 1988 and eventually to $593 billion in 1991.', 'Aides to Rudolph G. Penner, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said today that the new estimates were $10 billion to $15 billion higher for 1987 and for 1988, and more than $20 billion higher for 1991.', 'These figures suggest that it will be difficult for Congress to meet the deficit targets set in the budget-balancing law signed by President Reagan in December 1985.
