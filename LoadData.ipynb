Its tiny, incremental shifts were occasionally interrupted by busy outbursts that suggested the tolling of the hour.\",\n",

The piece was rich in beguiling timbres; one especially memorable passage paired Ms. Muhly's spiccato bounces with twinkling crotales. Anna Clyne's bustling, inventive ''Next.Stop'' was filled with melodies and rhythms derived from recorded subway announcements and other urban noises, punctuated by distorted growls and buzzes. Voices were electronically stretched in a slow central section, the sound curiously reminiscent of a muezzin's call to prayer.\",\n",
