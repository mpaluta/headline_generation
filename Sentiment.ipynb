      "Headline: A Little Bit Of Country Infuses A Pop Instinct\n",
      "[\"''We're about to get country on you,'' Brandi Carlile said on Friday night, during the encore portion of her second sold-out Bowery Ballroom show. She was speaking some truth -- the next song was Johnny Cash's ''Folsom Prison Blues'' -- but the warning came belatedly. Ms. Carlile and her band had just wrapped up a long set suffused with country feeling, though it wasn't always patently clear.\", 'Ms. Carlile, who hails from the outskirts of Seattle, has the kind of voice most Nashville producers would be happy to work with: roomy, dark-hued and bittersweet, with a firmness of purpose and pitch.', 'She favors one of the classic country-singer devices, an accented break between upper and lower ranges. At times she scoops dramatically up to a note, like a slide guitarist. And in the harmonies she strikes with her creative partners, the twins Tim and Phil Hanseroth, there are hints of bluegrass and Grand Ole Opry twang.', \"For ''The Story,'' her self-assured second album on Columbia, Ms. Carlile worked with the producer T Bone Burnett, the insider's outsider of country. (Or the outsider's insider; sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.)\", \"Consisting entirely of original songs, the album evinces a pop instinct even at its most rustic. A useful parallel would be the Indigo Girls, who lend their voices to ''Cannonball,'' lyrically one of Ms. Carlile's lesser tunes.\", \"''Cannonball'' was the opener on Friday, and Ms. Carlile performed it semi-acoustically, backed by only the lanky Hanseroth brothers on bass and guitar. (''The Twin-digo Girls,'' she called them afterward, with a chuckle.) Then the rest of the band -- a cellist, another guitarist and a drummer -- emerged for ''Late Morning Lullaby,'' the album's first track.\", \"Ms. Carlile brings a wide range of influences into her work, and a few cropped up throughout the show. ''Follow,'' from her self-titled debut, sounded a lot like Radiohead's ''No Surprises.'' A newer tune, ''Losing Heart,'' had the feel of an anthem by Ann and Nancy Wilson.\", \"''Closer to You,'' a two-step shuffle, segued into ''I've Just Seen a Face,'' by the Beatles. And ''My Song'' evoked Melissa Etheridge, in its declarative tone (''Here I am''), its metaphoric toughness (''My mind is full of razors'') and its instrumental punch.\", \"Besides ''Folsom Prison Blues,'' there were just two proper covers, and each occupied a dynamic extreme. Ms. Carlile attacked John Fogerty's ''Fortunate Son'' with abandon, letting the politically charged song speak for itself. By contrast, her final encore was ''Calling All Angels,'' originally a duet for Jane Siberry and K. D. Lang; she sang it in a delicate harmony with her younger sister, Tiffany Carlile.\", \"Ms. Carlile managed to compress a similar range of emotion within the tight dimensions of ''The Story,'' her album's title track. (It's also her biggest single, thanks to prominent placement on ''Grey's Anatomy.'') Phil Hanseroth wrote the tune, a slender 16-bar melody, and the lyrics, which culminate in a timeworn pop refrain: ''I was made for you.''\", \"Somehow Ms. Carlile made the song feel both confessional and monumental. Starting at a whisper and building to a roar, she deployed strategies borrowed from Jeff Buckley, among others. But what came across wasn't any calculation; it was simply the raw power of her voice, and the conviction to let it loose.\", 'MUSIC REVIEW']\n"

      "Headline: After Virginia Tech, Testing Limits of Movie Violence\n",
      "[\"If the horror at Virginia Tech has changed the chemistry of America's popular culture, those who count box-office receipts at Lionsgate would be among the first to know.\", \"The independent studio, a clearinghouse for some of the entertainment industry's most graphically violent fare, still plans to release on June 8 its ''Hostel: Part II,'' about the torture killing of college students.\", \"The movie will open as other studios are turning toward comedies like ''Knocked Up,'' capers like ''Ocean's 13,'' or fantasy adventures like ''Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.''\", \"Given its subject matter and the marketing campaign that has already come with it -- posters featuring a woman's severed head and other grisly images are now scattered on the Web -- the Lionsgate film is emerging as a test of continued audience enthusiasm for such onscreen brutality, which some commentators have connected with the Blacksburg gunman Seung-Hui Cho's video and its possible echoes of the Korean revenge film ''Old Boy.''\", \"''What might have been traditionally acceptable exploitation in one period can be seen as stupendously bad taste in another,'' said Martin Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California, which examines the links among entertainment, commerce and society.\", 'Eight years ago, in one such case, the Columbine High School killings fed a political storm around the marketing of violent entertainment to the young, and led to stricter policing of sales practices in the movie and video-game industries.', \"''You can't win on this one,'' said Peter Dekom, a longtime entertainment lawyer and author, with Peter Sealey, of ''Not on My Watch: Hollywood vs. the Future.''\", \"Mr. Dekom predicted that fallout from the killings would hurt the film's performance. But the damage would only grow deeper, he suggested, if Lionsgate delayed the film, allowing the Internet buzz to tag it as being troubled.\", \"Written and directed by Eli Roth, with Quentin Tarantino as an executive producer, ''Hostel: Part II'' follows an immensely lucrative predecessor, which cost only about $5 million to make, and took in more than $80 million worldwide when Lionsgate released it last year in partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment's Screen Gems division. (Sony, whose executives declined to comment, also has a stake in the new film.)\", \"The original film told the story of three young travelers who are lured by gorgeous women into captivity and deadly torture; the new picture follows three young women studying abroad who fall into much the same trap. Along with the three hits in its ''Saw'' series, the film cemented Lionsgate's reputation as a nonpareil distributor of so-called torture porn and helped to feed a surge in violent horror movies from virtually every major studio in recent years.\", \"(Lionsgate is not solely devoted to gore; it has also released the family-oriented Tyler Perry movies and ''Crash,'' which won the best picture Oscar for 2005. On Friday, the studio will open Sarah Polley's ''Away From Her,'' based on a short story by Alice Munro about an aging couple dealing with the onset of Alzheimer's disease.)\", \"Peter Wilkes, a Lionsgate spokesman, confirmed that his company plans to proceed with a June release for ''Hostel: Part II,'' but declined to discuss whether it planned to adjust the movie or its marketing campaign.\", 'In recent weeks, the Motion Picture Association of America, which reviews advertising materials for films that seek a rating, approved the severed head poster, with a proviso that it not be displayed in multiplex theaters, where children might be exposed to it, according to a person involved with the process.', \"Lionsgate has circulated additional images, including one of a dead or dying woman suspended upside down with fluid dripping from her nose. ''Hostel: Part II'' has not yet been rated, but like its predecessor, will probably receive an R rating.\", 'Even before the events in Blacksburg, the heavy run of violent films had gained attention from the government -- a Federal Trade Commission report this month found that studios were still selling R-rated fare to adolescents over the Internet, among other things -- just as the genre was beginning to show signs of audience fatigue.', \"Pictures like ''Dead Silence'' from Universal, ''The Hills Have Eyes 2'' from Fox Atomic, ''Grindhouse'' from the Weinstein Company, and ''The Reaping'' from Warner Brothers Pictures were box-office disappointments. And Sony's ''Vacancy,'' which opened on April 20 even as images of the Virginia killings continued to fill television screens, has pulled in just $14 million in its first 9 days.\", \"''You might have seen a little effect'' from Blacksburg in audience behavior a week ago, said Roy Lee, a film producer whose projects include a proposed remake of ''Old Boy'' for Universal.\", \"Mr. Lee said that film, initially intended as a project for Justin Lin, the director of ''Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,'' had fallen out of active development long before Mr. Cho's video and commentator chatter about supposed influences.\", \"Mr. Lee said that the killings have seriously shaken the prospects for his ''Battle Royale,'' based on a Japanese video game in which ninth graders imprisoned on an island are forced to kill one another. (Lionsgate's ''The Condemned,'' with a similar island face-off premise involving adults, opened this weekend to $4 million.) New Line Cinema has been working since last year for film rights to the game but has yet to sign a deal, according to Mr. Lee.\", \"But he said that he was glad the movie had not started production before the Blacksburg killings. ''We would have been slaughtered by the press,'' he said.\", \"Asked if he would still be willing to proceed with a ''Battle Royale'' movie, Mr. Lee said yes, though ''we might be a little more sensitive to some of the issues.'' A spokeswoman for New Line said she had ''no news'' about progress on the rights deal.\", \"The trade paper Variety reported last week that two films based on campus violence -- the documentary ''The Killer Within,'' about a planned killing spree at Swarthmore College in the 1950s, and the drama ''Dark Matter,'' about a dangerously disaffected Asian student -- are still looking for distributors.\", 'Yet Dr. Kaplan of the Lear Center, a former film executive for Disney, noted that popular culture has a way of riding out even the most shattering of events.', \"Dr. Kaplan added that he was hard-pressed to think of any event that had suddenly, and irrevocably, changed audience responsiveness. ''Famously, 9/11 was supposed to be the end of irony,'' he said. ''If anything, irony has blossomed.''\", \"Correction:  May 1, 2007, Tuesday  An article in Business Day yesterday about violence in movies involving college students in the wake of the shootings at Virginia Tech referred incorrectly to ''Battle Royale,'' which is about ninth graders imprisoned on an island who are forced to kill one another. It was originally a novel, not a video game.\"]\n"

      "Headline: Disease Drove Sex Attack, Defense Says\n",
      "[\"He was a media columnist for Women's Wear Daily who built a reputation on his writing about the counterculture of the 1960s and '70s. He got attention for his odd dress, a self-consciously nerdy, retro look that reminded some people of Austin Powers. His prose was dense, sarcastic, with intellectual overtones.\", 'Now the writer, Peter Braunstein, 43, is about to go on trial, charged with a bizarre crime against a woman who worked in his own newsroom. Prosecutors say he dressed as a firefighter, staged a fire to get into her Chelsea apartment, tied her to a bed, drugged her with chloroform and sexually molested her for 13 hours.', 'As the trial opens today in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, jurors will be asked to decide whether he was a sadistic man preying on an unsuspecting woman or whether his actions were the result of mental illness.', \"The defense has conceded that he committed the crime, and is working on a risky defense that will combine traditional psychiatric testimony with the burgeoning field of ''neurolaw,'' which holds that there is a biological basis for behavior. Prosecutors have said that steps Mr. Braunstein took before the attack show his intent.\", \"Mr. Braunstein's lawyer, Robert Gottlieb, has said he would show color images of his client's brain, called positron emission tomography, or PET, scans, that he said show that Mr. Braunstein had undiagnosed and, until his arrest, untreated paranoid schizophrenia that drove him to behave as he did.\", \"During jury selection last week, and in his court papers, Mr. Gottlieb said he planned to argue that Mr. Braunstein was so psychologically impaired that he could not form the intent to commit a crime. He has hinted that Mr. Braunstein's attack on the woman was part of an elaborate fantasy over which he had little conscious control.\", \"In similar cases, lawyers have argued that their clients were in a dissociated state, much like sleepwalking. A version of this defense, said Rachel Barkow, a law professor at New York University, would be: ''You know killing is wrong, but it turns out you think you're in the middle of a video game. Because of a paranoid delusional state, you thought it was all a fantasy.''\", 'A more classic lack of intention defense, said Stephen J. Morse, a professor of law and psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, would be that someone out hunting in the dark shot a person thinking he was shooting a tree.', \"Dr. Morse compared Mr. Braunstein's argument to that in Clark v. Arizona, in which the defendant, a paranoid schizophrenic, was convicted of killing an Arizona police officer. There, too, intent was one of the issues, he said. The defendant claimed that he thought aliens -- some impersonating government agents -- were trying to kill him. ''If he really believed that this was a space alien, he did not intend to kill a human being knowing it was a police officer,'' Dr. Morse explained. (The United States Supreme Court affirmed the murder conviction in 2006.)\", \"But the challenge of mounting such a defense, Dr. Morse said, is that ''even abnormal brains produce intention.'' Dr. Morse said that for a defendant to claim he was in an automatic state like sleepwalking for 13 hours would be unusual. ''Virtually always, when people claim they committed a crime in an automatic state, that automatic state was relatively transient,'' he said.\", \"At first glance, Mr. Braunstein seems an unlikely candidate for a high profile trial. He had a fairly ordinary upbringing in Kew Gardens, Queens. The strangest part of his past, according to court papers, may be the family secret he unearthed when he was 27. He found out that his cousin was also his half-brother, the son of his father's previous marriage to his aunt.\", \"But because of his connection to New York's fashion and media worlds, his story has been picked up not only by the crime-hungry tabloids, but by Vanity Fair and New York magazine.\", \"As if working off a script, Mr. Braunstein staged the crime on Oct. 31, 2005, Halloween night, the prosecutors said. In an echo of a scene from his failed 2004 play, ''Andy and Edie,'' about Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgwick, it appeared he had videotaped his attack, although court papers say the tape was blank. He left a Manolo Blahnik shoe -- the ultimate symbol of the fashion industry that had cast him out a few years before -- on the bed, the police said.\", \"Mr. Braunstein spent six weeks as a fugitive before being captured at the University of Memphis, where an employee recognized him from the television program ''America's Most Wanted.''\", \"His downward spiral began in 2002, according to court papers filed by the defense, when he was fired from Women's Wear Daily, in a dispute over free tickets to a Vogue event, and accelerated after he broke up with his girlfriend, Jane Larkworthy, the beauty editor at W magazine. ''Without the stabilizing factor of a regular job, Mr. Braunstein rapidly began to unravel psychologically,'' Barbara R. Kirwin, a clinical psychologist hired by the defense, said in a written report. He became suicidal and felt like a ''person who exists with no social identity,'' she said.\", 'But the fashion press, Dr. Kirwin added, was the wrong job for Mr. Braunstein from the beginning.', \"''Working in the highly competitive, glitzy and sexually charged atmosphere of a celebrity-driven fashion periodical was an extremely toxic and unsuitable environment for a socially compromised and marginally compensated schizotype like Mr. Braunstein,'' Dr. Kirwin wrote.\", \"''It was,'' she added, ''in fact the proverbial recipe for disaster.''\", \"The expert who conducted Mr. Braunstein's PET scans, Monte S. Buchsbaum, a professor of psychiatry at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, has worked with other high-profile defendants, including Vincent Gigante, the Mafia leader. Mr. Gigante was known for wandering Greenwich Village in a bathrobe and slippers, and prosecutors accused him of faking mental illness to avoid prosecution. Dr. Buchsbaum testified in 1997 that brain images showed Mr. Gigante suffered from dementia.\", 'In 2003, Mr. Gigante pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice, admitting he tried to outsmart the legal system by pretending he was mentally ill. Dr. Buchsbaum said in an interview last week that he stands by his diagnosis of Mr. Gigante, who died in 2005, and that he considered the guilty plea to be a legal maneuver.', \"In Mr. Braunstein's case, while the defense is putting forward an insanity defense, prosecutors have a more prosaic theory of what happened. Maxine Rosenthal, the lead prosecutor, argued in pretrial hearings that Mr. Braunstein was bitter over his breakup with Ms. Larkworthy and enraged at the fashion world for rejecting him.\", 'He could not attack Ms. Larkworthy, the prosecutor said, because she had taken out an order of protection against him, after accusing him of harassing and stalking her. So he lashed out at his co-worker, the prosecutor said, because she was an unwary surrogate for those who had betrayed and humiliated him.', \"The intentional element, the prosecutors said, can be seen in Mr. Braunstein's ordering of the firefighter's costume, chloroform and other supplies. He also called his probation officer in the stalking case to postpone an appointment scheduled for Oct. 31, the day of the attack.\", \"In the end, said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University, Mr. Braunstein will have to show why he should not be held accountable by society. ''Gottlieb can point to his very pretty color photograph of Braunstein's brain,'' Mr. Gillers said. ''But that's not going to be enough. He's got to satisfy the moral conscience of the jury, which is going to take this very seriously.''\"]\n"

      "Headline: No Ill Feelings: Producers Bet on a 'Superwoman'\n",
      "['Donna Murphy is feeling fine.', \"She's a few days from opening in the Manhattan Theater Company's production of ''LoveMusik,'' the Hal Prince-directed musical about the 25-year romance between Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya, and she's out there every night, crooning ''Speak Low'' with her co-star, Michael Cerveris, and belting out ''Surabaya Johnny'' in her meticulously researched Lotte Lenyese accent.\", 'No, nothing is bothering Ms. Murphy.', \"Well, there is that malady that she has been trying to shake for the last several years, a little condition that Broadway wags refer to as the ''Donna Murphy syndrome.''\", 'Strictly speaking, it means a tendency to miss a lot of performances; more broadly, it is all the gossip and sniping that has been directed at Ms. Murphy, who also happens to be one of the most ecstatically reviewed musical actresses around.', \"Not that long ago the gossip around Broadway was that Donna Murphy the star performer had been felled for good by the syndrome. It was about four years ago, with the troubled 2003 revival of ''Wonderful Town.'' The show was supposed to be, for Ms. Murphy, a delightful relief. She had shined in the Encores! production at City Center in 2000, but resisted joining a Broadway transfer for the next several years, despite near-constant courting by the producers Roger Berlind and Barry and Fran Weissler; Kathleen Marshall, the director; and even Adolph Green and Betty Comden, the lyricists.\", 'Maybe later, she said; first, she and her husband wanted to have a child. But then came two miscarriages, one after the other. At that point, the stage was starting to look like a reliable place to find peace of mind. So in 2003 she finally agreed, and the show was up and running.', 'Then she coughed.', 'It was only the second preview, she said, and she was rushing into her dressing room for a change. She went on a coughing jag, and something felt wrong.', \"''I remember saying to my management that night, 'I'm afraid I've hurt myself,' '' she recalled in an interview last week in her dressing room at the Biltmore, in which she addressed the experience in greater detail than she has before.\", 'The next morning she went to her doctor and her hunch was right: she had hemorrhaged in one of her vocal cords. The doctor ordered her to get out of the show.', 'Ms. Murphy went to two more doctors that day and the diagnosis was the same, though they said she might be able to continue with the show if she had some time off. The producers decided to cancel the next six performances; her understudy, the soon-to-be-quite-busy Linda Mugleston, went on in two performances after that.', \"Ms. Murphy had already developed, for one reason or another, a reputation for fragility, and the blatherskites around Broadway began whispering. The production insisted, as Mr. Weissler told The New York Times a week later, that it was simply ''a bad flu.'' Technically, that was accurate.\", \"''The ultimate decision was made to focus on the fact that I did have the flu and not make a mention of the fact that I'd hemorrhaged my cord,'' Ms. Murphy said.\", 'In an interview, Mr. Weissler said that what he said publicly was what he was told by her doctors at the time.', \"Whatever the case, Ms. Murphy's vocal trouble was jeopardizing a $5 million production that had been waiting for her for years. And she knew it. ''I felt guilty and responsible,'' she said.\", 'She came back into the show, at the consent of her doctor, a week after leaving. People were still asking questions about what had happened, how serious her problems were. But the reviews for the show were good and for Ms. Murphy, as usual, some were downright rapturous.', \"''On your knees, citizens of Broadway,'' Ben Brantley's review in The Times began. ''A superwoman walks among you.'' She didn't endear herself to anyone by being two hours late to her opening-night party. It seemed like a publicity hiccup at the time, but little things like that would add up to a big black mark in the press to come.\", \"But for now Mr. Brantley's impression was the definitive one. So back to the show, to the interviews, the recording sessions, the photo shoots and the packed holiday schedule. And before too long, back to Ms. Murphy's doctor.\", \"''You're at risk if you sing on this, if you speak on it,'' Ms. Murphy recalled the doctor saying at one point in mid-December. '' 'Let's take it day by day.' That began the period of on again, off again.''\", \"On her doctor's orders, Ms. Murphy took a day off here, a weekend off there, and it all began adding up, she said. As the show's grosses -- and Ms. Murphy's reputation -- began disintegrating during the spring, it was still unclear to many what was going on. Even people in the company were in the dark; all they knew was that she was out often and she didn't speak much when she was around.\", \"''There was a point where I asked if I could be open about what had happened and I was asked not to be'' by the producers, Ms. Murphy said. ''I had many thoughts about how I should have handled it. But I kept trying to come back to 'O.K., what's best for the show?' ''\", \"Mr. Weissler disputes that. ''In no way did I ever, ever, declare that we should not tell the public about this,'' he said.\", 'Against the advice of her doctor, she occasionally took steroids to keep her voice going, but the absences continued. Frustrated ticket buyers rescheduled when they arrived at the theater to find Ms. Murphy absent, only to find her out again when they went back.', 'It became conventional wisdom that her absences scuttled what would have been a strong possibility of a third Tony Award. Publicity missteps -- like Ms. Murphy not appearing at the Drama League luncheon or taking a few performances off to tape a pilot -- further dented her reputation.', 'In the summer, as the show limped along, Ms. Murphy tried to get out of her contract a month early, but there was no replacement who could be ready in time. She lost most of that month anyway, though. A Sunday matinee performance in late August for a Republican convention crowd turned out to be her last.', \"The next day Ms. Murphy's doctor told her she was at great risk for another hemorrhage, one much more serious, and ordered her to take a few weeks off, she said. Though Ms. Murphy had a scrap with the producers over whether she could return for the last handful of shows (she wanted to; the producers didn't want her to), the run for her was over. An unnamed producer told The New York Post that she would never be hired to star in a Broadway show again.\", \"''I felt bereft at the end of 'Wonderful Town,' '' Ms. Murphy said. ''Personally, I felt extremely sad, extremely disappointed, as if I had let people down. And there was the irony of having gone into something that I thought was both a way to experience and give joy.''\", 'The next two years she spent away from long-running shows, performing occasionally in one-night concerts and in movies and television shows. Most of her time, though, she spent on the process of adopting a daughter, Darmia, from Guatemala.', \"Ms. Murphy did not return to the stage in earnest until this year, first in the City Center Encores! production of ''Follies'' and now in ''LoveMusik.''\", \"The reviews for the ''Follies'' production were glowing. (Mr. Brantley called Ms. Murphy one of ''the finest portraitists working in musicals.'') And once again, there was talk of Broadway transfer (talk that has dwindled somewhat). And once again, Barry and Fran Weissler were pushing for the transfer, the same Weisslers who were rumored to be at wits' end with Ms. Murphy during ''Wonderful Town.''\", 'Hard feelings?', \"''Not at all,'' Mr. Weissler said. ''I called her personally.''\", \"There was one other lead producer of ''Wonderful Town'': Mr. Berlind. What is he producing these days? For one thing, ''LoveMusik.''\", \"''Donna was my first choice right from the beginning,'' he said. He did take time to reassure the other backers that she would be dependable. But as for himself, ''I had no trepidation at all.''\", \"So Mr. Weissler and Mr. Berlind insist that they have nothing against Ms. Murphy, and that, while the ''Wonderful Town'' experience was frustrating, Ms. Murphy's problems resulted from a streak of bad luck. But talk is cheap.\", 'There is perhaps no statement of trust stronger than staking a multi-million-dollar production on someone.', \"''She's one of the hardest working actors I've ever worked with,'' Mr. Weissler said. ''I just hope she doesn't get the flu.''\"]\n"

      "Headline: In Turkey, Fear and Discomfort About Religious Lifestyle\n",
      "['When hundreds of thousands of protesters filled the streets of Istanbul on Sunday, it may have looked like a protest of government policy.', 'It was not.', 'Behind the slogans and signs of marchers in Istanbul on Sunday and in Ankara two weeks ago was something much more basic: a fear of the lifestyles of their more religious compatriots.', 'Some concerns were snobbish: religious Turks were uneducated and poor, their pesky prayer rugs got underfoot in hospital halls.', 'Others were less elitist and had more personal worries: how much tolerance for our secular lifestyles will an emerging class of religious Turks have?', \"''These people are from poor areas; they just don't know what the government stands for,'' said Aysel Tuikman, 39, a civil servant wearing a skirt, a sweater, beige pumps and pearls. ''They're only being manipulated. We are here for their good also.''\", \"''People here are the real Turkey,'' she said, waving a flag high above her head.\", \"It is an emotional reaction to a relatively new layering of society that began 20 years ago but has accelerated recently. A massive migration from rural areas to Turkey's cities and a large-scale economic boom have drawn an entirely new class of religious Turks from the country's heartland into the life of its secular cities.\", 'The class is represented by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is challenging the secular elite, forcing a presidential candidate upon them whom they find completely distasteful.', \"On Friday, the military gave him a warning. It has ousted four elected governments since 1960, and seemed to be considering whether to make Mr. Erdogan's the fifth. On Sunday, Mr. Erdogan gave a warning of his own: He will continue to push his candidate, an action that will probably lead to early national elections.\", \"Secular Turks fear that Mr. Erdogan has a secret agenda to impose Islamic law on Turkey and that his party's move to secure the presidency, the highest seat of secularism in Turkey, is one of the final steps needed to start that process.\", \"Mr. Erdogan, for his part, came from Turkey's political Islamic movements of the 1990s, but he broke with them and formed his own, which swept national elections in 2002. He has said that he would keep religion out of policy decisions, and for the most part, he has.\", 'But for the protesters on Sunday, that was not enough.', \"''They say they've changed, but look at their wives,'' said Yalcin Turkdogan, 61, an architect who had not been to a protest since 1977. Mr. Erdogan's wife wears a head scarf.\", \"For Sevim Erzen, a retired civil servant at a protest in Ankara earlier this month, the number of women in head scarves moving into her wealthy Istanbul neighborhood was disturbing. ''They have started to look down on us,'' she said. ''They are trying to be part of the ruling class.''\", \"The message of secularist protesters, said Metin Heper, a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, was this: ''We are uncomfortable with the lifestyles of these people.''\", \"''They fear these people, but these fears are groundless,'' he said.

      "['Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr clashed with American forces in northern Baghdad on Sunday, an Interior Ministry official said, the latest in a series of indications that the militia might be emerging from two months of self-imposed dormancy.', 'On the orders of Mr. Sadr, the militia, known as the Mahdi Army, has remained largely underground since the intensified security plan for Baghdad took effect in mid-February. But a steady increase in the number of corpses recovered from the streets in recent weeks, and sporadic clashes between Mahdi fighters and government forces, have suggested a possible resurgence of the militia.', 'Its return could significantly complicate the American-led effort to tame violence in the capital because it would split the attention of American and Iraqi forces, already struggling to subdue the Sunni Arab insurgency and interrupt its campaign of vehicle bombings against Shiite targets.', 'The circumstances of the latest fighting remained unclear late Sunday.', 'The Interior Ministry official said American soldiers and Mahdi militiamen exchanged heavy gunfire near a prominent Shiite shrine in the Shiite neighborhood of Kadhimiya, and that two American Humvees had burst into flames. The ministry official offered no explanation for the clashes.', \"Sheik Khalid al-Kadhumy, an official in Mr. Sadr's organization, said that American forces surrounded the Sadr offices in the Kadhimiya neighborhood in the evening. Something prompted the Americans to open fire on the office and surrounding buildings, he said, resulting in casualties among local residents, though he did not know how many.\", 'Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, an American military spokesman in Baghdad, said that he had no comment on reports of the fighting but that the military was working on a statement about the clashes.', 'Some members of the Shiite community have been agitating for a return of the Mahdi Army in recent weeks, as spectacular car bombings against Shiite communities in Baghdad killed hundreds of people. The militia is regarded by many Shiites as a bulwark against militant Sunni Arabs.', 'Three weeks ago, American forces fought Mahdi cells in the southern city of Diwaniya. And late last month, Mahdi fighters battled Iraqi Army soldiers in southwestern Baghdad. But military officials hoped those were localized clashes.', 'Also on Sunday, a roadside bomb in the Zaafaraniya district of southern Baghdad killed two people and wounded seven, and three garbage collectors were killed by gunmen in Adhamiya, the Interior Ministry official said.', 'An Iraqi soldier was killed in a drive-by shooting at a checkpoint in the Salaam neighborhood in western Baghdad, the official added, and the authorities recovered 11 bodies dumped on the streets.', 'A British soldier was shot and killed in the southern city of Basra on Sunday, the 12th British soldier to die this month, Reuters reported. Four members of the Yezidi faith were killed in Mosul: two civilians on Saturday and two police officers on Sunday, a police officer in Mosul said.', \"Gunmen in a passing car gravely wounded one of Iraq's most famous broadcasters, Amal Kadhum al-Mudaris, near her house in the Khudra neighborhood of western Baghdad, the police said. She was in serious but stable condition on Sunday night, officials said.\", \"During her 43-year career in radio and television, Ms. Mudaris, 60, has become a familiar voice to many Iraqis. She has recently been the host of a morning call-in show on the Iraqi Net radio station, in which she seeks to assuage people's suffering and help resolve their problems with government ministries.\", 'The police, as well as friends and colleagues of Ms. Mudaris, said they did not know why she was attacked. The shooting came nearly four weeks after another Iraqi broadcaster, Khamael Mohsin, was slain by gunmen in Baghdad.', \"Ms. Mudaris ''is one of the most distinguished voices on Iraqi radio and has touched families' hearts,'' said Hafid al-Adelie, the head of Iraq's Radio and Television Broadcasters Union.\", 'THE REACH OF WAR']\n"

American forces took the younger child, along with an adult female relative, for medical treatment, the statement said.', \"''During the operation, coalition forces received small-arms fire from several militants as they attempted to enter the compound,'' it said. ''Coalition forces returned fire, killing four militants. An adult woman and a teenager were also killed in the cross-fire between militants and coalition forces.''\", 'There is growing anger in Afghanistan over raids on houses and civilian casualties, and legislators and tribal elders from eastern Afghanistan have warned that the attacks are playing into the hands of the insurgents.', 'The raid occurred in the same area of Nangarhar Province where at least 10 civilians were killed by American marines who began firing at vehicles and pedestrians on the main highway after being hit by a suicide bomb attack on March 4.', 'The initial report from the American military said that the marines had been caught in a complex ambush, coming under small-arms fire after the bombing. But an investigation by the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission found that the marines used excessive force in the situation and killed at least 12 civilians. American military investigators involved in an inquiry said they had found no evidence that the marines were fired on after the initial attack.', \"Hajji Lewani, a resident of the area who was wounded in the March 4 shooting and whose father and two other relatives were killed, attended the funeral for the people killed on Sunday. In a telephone interview, he said, ''Two women and two men were from a family who were living here and were originally from Tagab district, and one man is from a separate family of the area.''\", 'He said he did not know whether the people were involved in any activities against the Afghan government or American forces.', 'THE REACH OF WAR']\n"

Tenet, that she had dismissed his warnings in July 2001 of possible terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda.', \"In his new book, ''At the Center of the Storm,'' to be published on Monday, Mr. Tenet wrote that there had been no ''serious debate'' within the Bush administration about whether Iraq posed an imminent threat or on how a long American military presence in Iraq might play out; and that his early efforts to warn Ms. Rice and others of Al Qaeda's threats were treated too lightly.\", \"Ms. Rice, who appeared on several Sunday television talk shows, said on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation'' that the administration had tried many ways to deal with Iraq, over ''an extended period of time,'' including efforts to tighten international sanctions.\", \"In an excerpt from a taped CBS interview, broadcast on the program ''60 Minutes'' Sunday, Mr. Tenet said that in a briefing he had urgently requested with Ms. Rice in July 2001, he said words to this effect: ''There are going to be multiple, spectacular attacks against the United States. We believe these attacks are imminent. Mass casualties are likely.''\", \"''We need to consider immediate action inside Afghanistan now,'' he said he had advised.\", \"Ms. Rice said that did not seem to track with what Mr. Tenet had told the bipartisan Sept. 11 commission in testimony, and added, ''I don't know what we were supposed to pre-emptively strike in Afghanistan.''\", \"When Mr. Bush took office in early 2001, the Sept. 11 commission's report found, he and his advisers ''accepted that Al Qaeda was responsible'' for the October 2000 attack on the United States destroyer Cole, but ''did not like the options available for a response.\", \"''The Bush administration began developing a new strategy with the stated goal of eliminating the Al Qaeda threat within three to five years,'' the commission's report said.\", \"Ms. Rice was also asked about Mr. Tenet's much-quoted reference in the prelude to the Iraq war about the case for the war being a ''slam dunk,'' a basketball term used to indicate that there was little doubt.\", 'Mr. Tenet has said he meant to convey that it would be easy to make the public argument for going into Iraq, not that the intelligence of an Iraqi threat was irrefutable.', \"''When George said 'slam dunk,' '' Ms. Rice said, ''everybody understood that he believed that the intelligence was strong.\", \"''We all believed the intelligence was strong.''\", \"In an unusual reaction to Mr. Tenet's book, the State Department sent reporters on Sunday a three-page document underscoring comments the former C.I.A. chief had made to the Sept. 11 commission.\", \"It quoted him as saying of the emerging terrorist threat, in the spring and summer of 2001, ''reporting was maddeningly short on actionable details.''\", \"''The most ominous reporting hinting at 'something big' was also the most vague.''\", \"It also quoted him as saying that upon taking office, ''The new group,'' meaning the Bush administration in early 2001, ''also immediately understood what we were talking about here, and bin Laden and Al Qaeda became an agenda item early on with the national security adviser and the president.''\", 'THE REACH OF WAR']\n"

      "['Travis Zajac, a 21-year-old rookie center for the Devils, retreated with his teammates to the locker room after the third period Saturday night. He was not quite sure what to expect when the door was closed.', 'The Devils had lost a lead to the Ottawa Senators with 27 seconds left in regulation, extending the game into overtime, and Devils right wing Brian Gionta had been called for a hooking penalty at the end of regulation.', 'Zajac, who was playing for the University of North Dakota in the N.C.A.A. Frozen Four last April, said he was somewhat agitated, especially because his line had wasted so many chances. The interesting part, however, was that no one else was agitated.', \"''It's experience,'' Zajac said. ''They know that something like that goal is not getting to us.''\", 'Early in the second overtime period, Zajac chipped the puck to Jamie Langenbrunner, the right wing on his line, and Langenbrunner beat Senators goaltender Ray Emery on a breakaway to lift the Devils to a 3-2 victory in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series.', \"Langenbrunner's goal helped the Devils tie the best-of-seven series at one victory apiece. It was his 12th game-winning playoff goal -- and fourth in overtime -- in 120 postseason games.\", \"But Langenbrunner, a 31-year-old veteran from Cloquet, Minn., is not the only Devils player with a lot of playoff seasoning. Ten Devils who played in Saturday's game have at least 90 games of playoff experience. No one on the Senators has that much.\", \"''There's no panic in this locker room,'' Langenbrunner said. ''We all trust in each other to get the job done.''\", 'As the series moves to Ottawa, where Games 3 and 4 are to be played Monday and Wednesday, it has become clear that the Senators have more speed and skill. What the Devils have on their side is that they have been through this before.', 'Six Devils have played in more than 100 playoff games. Goaltender Martin Brodeur, who turns 35 on Sunday, has played in 161 playoff games (winning 94 of them, as well as three Stanley Cups).', \"After he allowed five goals in the Devils' lackluster loss to Ottawa in Game 1, Brodeur decided to use a new set of pads. For most goaltenders, taking out a new set of pads for a playoff game may be like wearing no pads at all.\", \"''I just wanted to feel good -- feel different,'' Brodeur said.\", 'Brodeur stopped 43 of 45 shots Saturday, some spectacularly. He stopped all 14 shots he faced in the two overtime periods. He gave up the tying goal to Dany Heatley in the final minute, but that was because Heatley, uncovered, shot from 10 feet away.', \"''We don't worry about him,'' Langenbrunner said of Brodeur.\", 'What the Devils talked about after regulation, and apparently calmly, was how they would kill the penalty on Gionta. They did, and without much trouble. They did not dwell on how Heatley, a 50-goal scorer in the regular season, could set up in the low slot.', \"''You just have to stay positive and play the game, and that's what we did,'' said Sergei Brylin, who scored the Devils' second goal with two-tenths of a second left in the first period.\", 'Zajac, who had 17 goals and 25 assists in the regular season, gave Langenbrunner a chance early in the second overtime simply by winning a race to a loose puck and knocking it up the ice. Langenbrunner raked it in and sped away.', \"''Probably the fastest I've skated in a while,'' Langenbrunner said, smirking.\", 'He appeared as if he would shift the puck from his forehand to his backhand, and Emery was fooled. Langenbrunner swept the puck past Emery and was soon mobbed by Zajac and the left wing on the line, Zach Parise, who is 22.', \"''What can you say about the two kids?'' said Scott Gomez, the center on the Devils' top line. ''They were awesome all night.''\", 'In fact, Zajac was disappointed that his line had not scored a goal earlier Saturday, in his eighth playoff game.', 'Langenbrunner joked after the game that he had missed scoring about eight goals before his winner. But they all pressed on.', \"''We should have ended it in regulation, but those things happen,'' said center John Madden, who played in his 97th playoff game Saturday. ''We just turned the page and said: 'It's over with. We can't change it now. Let's kill the penalty and look for the game winner.' ''\", 'HOCKEY']\n"

      "['There is rare good news from the otherwise grim budget front. Majorities in both the House and Senate have voted to impose a pay-as-you-go rule, starting with the 2008 federal budget, which they plan to complete this spring.', \"''Pay-go,'' which was abandoned in 2002, is vital to restoring budget discipline. It would require Congress to pay for new spending on entitlements, like Medicare, either by raising taxes or cutting other entitlements. It would also require legislators to make up forgone revenue from new tax cuts by raising other taxes or cutting spending.\", \"There are differences, however, in the chambers' approaches to pay-go. The House's approach is better because it has no tricky escape hatches. In contrast, the Senate's version of the budget contains an amendment that would make it all too easy to sidestep the rule. For example, 60 senators would be able to pass a bill today to extend Bush-era tax cuts set to expire in 2010, claiming that the resulting revenue losses would be ''paid for'' by a budget surplus projected for 2012.\", 'The amendment would pose a big temptation to game the process, with a predictably bad outcome. Even if the projected surplus materialized, it would be temporary because of looming obligations for retiring baby boomers. So, using up the surplus in advance would only guarantee more federal debt later.', \"Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has championed the amendment as a way to smooth extension of otherwise expiring middle-class tax cuts, like the child tax credit. But it could just as well be used to gut the estate tax for America's wealthiest families or to bolster tax breaks for investors. In any event, the Baucus amendment violates the whole point of pay-go, which is to stick to it in the interest of long-term budget health.\", \"In coming up with a final budget bill, Democrats and Republicans alike should embrace the House's clean, tough approach to pay-go. That would ensure that any renewal of expiring tax cuts would be married to a realistic plan to pay for them, based on resources at hand rather than projections. Pay-go itself should be waived only in a real budget emergency -- as in 1993, when it was waived to extend unemployment benefits temporarily in the aftermath of a recession. Lawmakers' unrelenting desire to lock in constituent-pleasing tax cuts is not what we would call an emergency.\", 'Editorial']\n"
