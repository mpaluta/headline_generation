A few blocks away and minutes earlier, a group of older Palestinian men bemoaned what they said was rampant crime among Palestinians here and asked a pointed question with implications for the crippled Israeli-Palestinian peace effort:

INPUT:After months of legal skirmishing over New York City's policies regarding older students who have fallen behind, lawsuits charging that three high schools illegally discharged struggling students have been resolved. In the process, a tentatively cooperative relationship has emerged between the Department of Education and Advocates for Children, the group that brought the lawsuits. In a memorandum accompanying the final settlement, Jack B. Weinstein, a senior judge in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, said that although the lawsuits directly affect only a few of the city's 1.1 million students, the principles involved, accepted by the city, ''set an important standard for the entire system.'' Judge Weinstein said the cases ''exposed a lesion -- the alleged 'pushing out' of difficult-to-educate students -- that has been festering for many years,'' all the way back to a case he heard 35 years ago against one of the schools, Franklin K. Lane.

Today's city orchestras have developed large lists of wealthy elderly patrons who are knowledgeable about both the music and the lives of the "dead masters" and probably consider the time and money spent acquiring this knowledge wisely devoted. In prior generations, as Joseph Horowitz noted, "musical pedagogy at all levels had stressed the ability to read music, to play an instrument, to perceive musical forms." But the times, they have a-changed. My peers and I in Trumbull, Conn., were not required to take music classes. I personally benefited by having parents who could afford private piano lessons, but it is not beyond the realm of possibility that many of my peers graduated with high honors yet never took a class in music.

This makes it all the more important for Senate Democrats to stand united. Opponents do not now have the votes to reject his nomination, but it is essential to demonstrate with as many votes as possible that Mr. Ashcroft cannot convert the Justice Department into a place of hostility to civil liberties and the rights of women, minorities and gays. So far only Democrats have risen to oppose this nomination. But Republicans with diverse constituencies, such as Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, should recognize that they will be held accountable if Mr. Ashcroft's record of insensitivity turns out to be a predictor of his performance. President Bush, as this page has said, is entitled to wide latitude in the selection of his cabinet. But as we have also said, the attorney general must be a reliable protector of abortion rights, existing civil rights law and the Constitution. Mr. Ashcroft's refusal to condemn Bob Jones University as racist, his opposition to a voluntary desegregation plan in Missouri and his smear campaign against Ronnie White, an African-American state judge nominated for the federal bench, went far beyond what other conservatives have done.

INPUT:To the Editor: Your ''Belgrade Journal'' (Sept. 12) reports from Yugoslavia that Serbia's nationalists seek ''to regain full control over the autonomous regions of Kosovo and Vojvodina.'' This suggests that historically these regions have been part of Serbia. While Kosovo's history has recently been written about in this country, less is known of Vojvodina and its constituent parts: Backa, Banat and the Srem. Vojvodina is a 3,500-square-mile area populated by two million people. Its land is 60 percent cultivated; it is the breadbasket and the most prosperous region in Serbia. Until the conquest by the Turks in the 16th century, for six centuries the region belonged to the Hungarian crown. It was restored to the Hungarian crown by the treaty of Passarowitz in 1699, and it remained part of Hungary until the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, which ceded it to Yugoslavia. In 1920, Yugoslavia annexed from Hungary 8,200 square miles, with a population of 1.6 million. Thus, Serbia had ''full control'' of this area for only 26 years of the last 1,000. In 1946, Vojvodina received autonomy. Serbia is attempting to eliminate this autonomy and regain the ''full control'' it had for those 26 years.

The letter, signed by 22 of the 33 members of the Cultural Institutions Group, which is made up of cultural organizations that receive city financing, called the Mayor's actions a ''dangerous precedent'' that could cause ''lasting damage'' to cultural life in New York. Those who signed represented a diverse group that included the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Staten Island Historical Society, the Bronx Zoo and the Queens Botanical Garden. Ten nonmembers, including the Frick Collection, the Museum of Modern Art, the Morgan Library and the Jewish Museum, also signed. But 10 member organizations -- among them Carnegie Hall and the New York State Theater -- refused to sign. (The other member is the Brooklyn Museum itself.) The missing signatures stood out even more last week when cultural institutions as far off as the Seattle Art Museum joined the Municipal Art Society's friend-of-the-court brief supporting the Brooklyn Museum in its lawsuit to prevent the Mayor from withholding city money over art he finds offensive.

On Tuesday evening, Riccardo Muti and the Philadelphia Orchestra achieved that effect in the finale of the Tchaikovsky Fourth Symphony, when for a few moments the ensemble and the hall worked as single, enveloping mechanism. The performance cut both ways, of course. It showed that glorious sound is still possible at Carnegie; but it reminded one that this quality, once the norm, is now the exception. For most of Tuesday's concert, in fact, it was business as usual, acoustically, and something better than that musically. When Mr. Muti became music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, in 1980, much was made of his statement that he did not know much contemporary American music. And although no one could accuse him of becoming a crusader for the repertory, he has, to his credit, explored it diligently over the last 10 years. He has also struck up relationships with a few living composers, most notably Bernard Rands, the orchestra's current composer in residence, and Richard Wernick, who has been his new-music consultant since 1983. Mr. Muti opened Tuesday's program with the New York premiere of Mr. Wernick's Symphony No. 1, a 20-minute work composed in 1988 for the Northeastern Pennsylvania Philharmonic. The piece had its powerful moments, beginning with a resolute pedal tone opening, interrupted in its first three minutes only by intermittent percussion explosions and bursts of toneless string snapping.

The warhead miniaturization technology lost to China from Los Alamos may allow it to challenge American superiority on the most reliable strategic weapons -- multiple-warhead,  submarine-launched ballistic missiles.

INPUT:Aftershocks from the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. swept through the markets last week, as traders openly questioned the financial health of several other Wall Street firms. But top financial officers of a number of large brokerage firms and leading credit analysts said the problems that suddenly engulfed Drexel are unlikely to be repeated. The way Drexel financed its operations was particularly perilous, they said, and is atypical of the rest of the Street. ''Drexel's capital structure and business was far different from other brokerage firms,'' said Jeffrey Bowman, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. ''For others to experience similar problems is highly remote.'' Specifically, Drexel relied heavily on a technique called ''double leverage'' to finance its broker-dealer operations. Double leverage means a firm borrows at the holding company level and lends those funds to a subsidiary, which in turn can use the money as collateral with which to raise more money. Essentially, the same funds can be put to work twice.

The International Olympic Committee released its initial evaluation of the 2012 bids last month, and New York City has faded to a fourth-place contender. This is very worrying. In the current geopolitical environment, and with the sense that it's Europe's turn in the Olympic rotation, an American city has to have technical brilliance to win. The committee found several flaws with the current plan. The Olympic village was rated seventh out of the nine applicant cities because the site is too small and congested. The transit plan was heavily criticized because athletes would have to navigate multiple transfers between buses, ferries and trains to get to their destinations. The public's 2-to-1 opposition to a West Side stadium factored into the last place finish in the ''support'' category.

But it should also celebrate a new conductor, share a program with Mendelssohn and Shostakovich, justify its expense and serve as an orchestra's single world premiere for an entire concert season.

INPUT:To the Editor: Instead of ''educating'' the Soviets on terminology, as Adam L. Schulman so haughtily suggests (Op-Ed, Sept. 15), we might begin to recognize that our political terminology, such as ''left'' and ''right,'' is of limited utility in situations like that of the Soviet Union today. After all, terms derived from the seating arrangement of the French Estates General two centuries ago and the way political activists distributed themselves there are likely not to fit post-Communist politics. Many of the left in the old radical, revolutionary, anti-statist sense would not accept Yegor Ligachev as one of them, for he is a ''statist,'' or one who promotes the supposed virtues of the Russian state. (To call it a ''Soviet state'' would be to coin an oxymoron.) The left, when true to its ideals, has always been at least strongly suspicious of the state, its needs and its proclivities. Even Lenin wrote ''State and Revolution'' and suggested the revolution avoid creating a strong state. Professor Schulman's article is clever but narrow. The attempt of post-Communist politics to produce ''something resembling free-market capitalism'' is definitely not, as Professor Schulman erroneously claims, ''the victory of conservatism,'' for the survivors of Communism understand, as several ''Soviet,'' Yugoslav and other East European citizens have said to me, that the existence of a healthy private enterprise allows the existence of that diversity and decentralization of political power that prevents the state, be it ''leftist''or ''rightist,'' from crushing our humanness.

INPUT:Three years ago, Alan Alpert's son, John, then 4, was having trouble speaking and understanding in preschool. School officials, Mr. Alpert said, suggested he enroll his son in the private Mary McDowell School for Learning, which specializes in teaching the learning disabled. But the school, based at the Brooklyn Friends Meeting House on Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn Heights, simply couldn't fit any more students in its space. That summer, the Alperts enrolled John in a public school, though they were concerned that his needs would not be met there. But before school started, they got a call from Debbie Zlotowitz, Mary McDowell's head of school, who asked if John would mind studying in the Brooklyn Heights Synagogue, which they might use as a school annex. Mr. Alpert was thrilled. ''It was probably the most significant important event of my life that they had a place for my son,'' he said. John, now 7, started that semester, and is in his third year at Mary McDowell, where he is one of 82 students. ''His progress has been outstanding,'' Mr. Alpert said.

INPUT:Every once in a while something happens to demonstrate the powers of firm political leadership coupled with the good will of ordinary citizens. A case in  point is the agreement announced yesterday between New York City and upstate communities to clean up the 2,000-square-mile watershed that supplies drinking water to seven million city dwellers and one million suburbanites. There are weaknesses in the plan, but it represents a huge step forward. On a purely financial level, it will spare the city and its taxpayers the cost of building an $8 billion filtration plant. Politically, it represents a rare triumph of good sense over once insurmountable grievances. To grasp the importance of this agreement it is necessary to understand some complicated history. New York City has long had the power to acquire property around the city's 19 reservoirs and to regulate development on adjacent lands. Because the city did not exercise that power for many years, local residents naturally got the idea that they could do whatever they liked. Development proceeded rapidly, first in Westchester County, later in Putnam County and now in the Catskills. Water quality declined, and in 1989 the Federal Government ordered the city to clean up the watershed or build a filtration plant it simply could not afford.

His political astuteness enabled him to craft legislation that both Republicans and Democrats agreed on in 1996. This will be a lasting legacy of his administration. Al Gore could do for education what his boss did for welfare. In polls during the primaries, voters consistently said that education was their foremost concern.

When the deal is formally completed, the company would be turned over to an investor group that will try to raise $500 million more. With the rescue, second only to the bailout in 1984 of Continental Illinois National Bank of Chicago, First Bancorporation becomes the last of Houston's big bank holding companies to lose its autonomy in the wake of Texas's depression.

''The trip by car is an aggravation,'' Mr. D'Alessio said as he parked his vehicle on one of the ferry's two car decks before heading topside to enjoy the journey. ''Riding the ferry across Long Island Sound is an excursion and very relaxing. It's a great alternative to making the trip by car.'' Since the early 1980's, more and more Long Islanders, frustrated with ever-worsening traffic conditions on highways to and from the Island, have turned to the Port Jefferson ferry to get to New England. The increase in ridership has been so rapid that the Bridgeport-Port Jefferson Steamship Company, which had operated two car-carrying ferries since 1983, has added the P. T.

St.-Germain had already suffered a blow after a Christian Dior boutique replaced the popular bookstore Le Divan. This time, however, the neighbors, including Catherine Deneuve, who spoke out against Armani, were not about to leave their signature style to chance, let alone to a Milanese designer: the shopkeepers started a club to keep out Mr. Armani called the Comité St.-Germain-des-Prés.

The jailhouse cook, an awkward, lonely teenage girl, approaches him with curiosity and fascination. The prisoner tries to cajole her into helping him escape. What at first seems a manipulative game of flattery and exploitation evolves into a fierce bond that the audience comes to believe in, even though it is easy to see that the meeting will end tragically. This is the plot of William Saroyan's ''Hello Out There,'' one of the works in ''Unexpected: Four One-Act Plays,'' a production by the Urban Youth Theater.

INPUT:Toward the end of the 19th century, the United States government told a doleful public that the frontier was officially closed, and that nearly three centuries of steady westward expansion were now at an end. The public was crushed by this announcement, because the sense of unlimited freedom and potential for self-reinvention that the frontier had long conferred on the American people would now have to be replaced by things far less romantic, like trains, planes, money or alcohol. It was terribly sad, but the American people would just have to deal with it. And deal with it they did. Something of similarly epic proportions has occurred in the entertainment industry at the end of the 20th century: To all appearances, the age of the ingenue has officially ended. For almost a century, Hollywood has thrived on the concept of the anointed one -- the gorgeous, talented, lovable unknown who has been hand-picked by the fates to be ''the next big thing.'' The public has long reveled in this elaborate ritual, because it reinforces the basic human conviction that lightning can strike anyone, anywhere, as long as the target has great legs and good bone structure. Equally central to the cult of the ingenue is the notion that by placing the callow, untested goddess-to-be in the eye of the media storm, magazine editors and television producers somehow sneak their readers and viewers in on the ground floor, allowing them to celebrate the ingenue's triumph before she has actually achieved it. In short, to be enthusiastic co-conspirators in a plot that may not actually work. This is what happened when Vanity Fair gave Gretchen Mol the big buildup in 1998. The public did get in on the ground floor. Ironically, this was the same floor Mol got off on. Obviously, for the cult of the ''precelebrity'' to thrive, it has always been incumbent upon the ingenues to actually become famous, to get their careers off the ground. Tragically, our most recent ingenues have not been up to snuff. Julia Ormond, canonized by a number of fashion and entertainment magazines as the next big thing just four years ago, came and went without a peep. Mol, a complete unknown when she graced the cover of Vanity Fair in September 1998, has achieved the herculean feat of being even more completely unknown today. Meanwhile, any number of Kate Winslets, Teri Hatchers, Renee Zellwegers and radiant runway models have been fleetingly designated the next ''It Girl,'' without ever becoming, well, it. Think of them as distaff Antonio Banderases: glimmering, shimmering stars that are frequently seen but never actually noticed.

The Hollywood studios and independent stations want Congress to keep the restrictions, which were instituted when viewers had few alternatives to network programs. That is no longer the case.

As the Chinese expand trade with the West and make greater use of computers and the Internet, the thinking goes, an unstoppable current of ideas will spur political reform. ''When over 100 million people in China can get on the Net,'' President Clinton has argued, ''it will be impossible to maintain a closed political and economic society.'' But will it? The Chinese government will never squelch all dissident voices on the Web, but because Internet communication relies on each person or computer having a unique, traceable address, the authorities can find ways to locate users and punish activities they don't like.

This fall, five authors have chosen the events of Sept. 11, 2001, as a way to explore the American way of life and to write about themselves. A handful of books among the 1,285 new titles being published here this month hardly represent a trend, but the World Trade Center theme has caught the eye of newspaper and magazine literary editors, whose job it is to decide which new books merit attention. And one novel, Frédéric Beigbeder's ''Windows on the World'' (the title is in English), has already been singled out as a contender for this year's prestigious Goncourt Prize. These books fit into no single category. There are two novels, one polemical nonfiction book, one book for young readers and one autobiographic comic-strip book. There are also several new books that use the terrorist attacks as a point of departure for political analysis. They demonstrate the perception here that 9/11 was a watershed, not only for the United States but also for France.

The results confirmed expectations on Wall Street that MCI's double-digit growth had been slowed by the AT&T Corporation's aggressive marketing campaign, and they reinforced a concern that MCI may have to endure at least several more sluggish months before it regains its balance. MCI's stock ended little changed in heavy trading, closing down 18.75 cents, at $17.50, on the Nasdaq market. Company executives had carefully warned Wall Street analysts over the last month about its slower growth.

The errors do not pose an immediate safety threat but the agency wants to determine if they are ''indicative of systemic issues in the production system,'' said Beth Erickson, the agency's director of aircraft certification. Ms. Erickson said the Boeing Company had reported four ''slips'' in its quality control system recently. It delivered a 767 with a bolt that had not been tightened enough, and for years it has been building planes with air ducts and moisture barriers that fail flammability tests because they have too much glue, she said. In addition, at the urging of the Environmental Protection Agency, Boeing switched the cleaner it uses to scrub fuel tank parts before anticorrosion coatings are applied to them, she said, but as a result, pieces of the coating have been peeling off into the fuel.

Fire officials said a small, smoldering fire turned into disaster after the sprinkler system in the chute failed to function, apparently because the water had been turned off. Firefighters were also hampered by a broken standpipe valve at the base of the building, which forced one firefighter to run several hundred feet of hose around a corner to a working valve. No Smoke Detectors Firefighters first responded to a report of a basement fire at 7:56 A.M. at one of the 35-story twin towers of the Schomburg Plaza apartments at 1295 Fifth Avenue, near 110th Street, in Harlem. It was not until 20 minutes later that firefighters realized that the blaze had spread upward and was burning on at least three floors of the pink concrete tower, the city's Fire Commissioner, Joseph E.

Governor Rowland and his fellow Republicans in the legislature have stressed their desire to put a brake on, or even pare, state spending, while Democrats said they hoped to take advantage of the booming economy to make progress on education and other issues that took a back seat as the state struggled out of the recent recession. Mr. Rowland does not plan to ask for any new big-ticket projects, but he told legislators he would not retreat on any of the major programs passed during his first term, including health coverage for uninsured children, open-space preservation and pollution reduction in Long Island Sound.

INPUT:Ever tried throwing a ball underwater? You just can't get it from here to there. But dive in with the Toypedo, a new rubber toy that looks like a V-2 rocket, and suddenly there's an unfamiliar thrust to water sports. "A 12-year-old, with some practice, can throw it up to 40 feet," says Jon Warner, its inventor. These days, simple-looking toys are anything but simple. Consider that the Toypedo's creator has a Ph.D. in oceanography and spent 15 years in marine engineering. "The two critical characteristics of the toy," Warner says, "are its shape, which involved hydrodynamics software running on some fairly heavy-duty computers, and the density of the material." Thanks to the shaping of the toy's body and its smooth skin, it glides through the water with very little drag. And the density of the polymer is important because too light a toy would pop to the surface and too heavy a toy would plummet. "The Toypedo has slight negative buoyancy," Warner says, "so that as it slows down, it gently glides toward the bottom, using gravity to get a little bit of extra distance."

INPUT:FOR THOSE WHO SCOOPED UP THE GOLD evening bag, the large wooden humidor and the worn footstool, the Kennedy name again proved that it had lost none of its magic. For four days in April, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis estate auction at Sotheby's in New York proved the best show in town as prices soared into the stratosphere. In the end, the thousands of pieces on the block brought in $34.5 million, roughly seven times the presale estimate. Not so curiously, some items simply stayed in the family. One of the biggest prizes, a set of golf clubs in a tattered bag that carried President Kennedy's initials, was claimed for $772,500 by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the husband of Mrs. Onassis' niece Maria Shriver. Not everybody was collecting memorabilia of famous people. Asian art rebounded from its doldrums of the early 90's. Early in the year, the blockbuster exhibition ''Splendors of Imperial China'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art outdrew the museum's Russian extravaganza, ''Faberge in America.'' The first International Asian Art Fair attracted leading dealers from around the world, and some $55 million worth of artworks were sold. A record price for Asian art, $8.6 million, was set with the sale of a 17th-century ceramic Korean dragon jar at Christie's in October. On the design front, a spiffed-up Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum reopened in September. Floors that no longer creak and brightly painted walls gave the museum a much-needed lift. And the design hero of the year proved to be Charles Rennie Mackintosh, a pioneer of Modernism. From the high-backed chairs to the botanical watercolors, Mackintosh's turn-of-the-century Glasgow came to life in a splashy exhibition at the Metropolitan. It is hard to believe now that when Mackintosh died in 1928 he had been largely forgotten.

Since Congress is insensible of the meaning of that word, higher deficits won't help. Smarter deficits will. And about considering deficit spending as capital investment: Alexander Hamilton already developed that idea. He reduced the deficit by funding it, and for the purpose of then expanding it on productive investments. If only universities would teach American economics as painstakingly written by Hamilton in his four reports to Congress while Secretary of the Treasury, and Benjamin Franklin's ''Modest Inquiry Into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency'' (written at age 23 in 1729), then we would get a greater return on our tax dollars, and spend less importing inferior economic ideas.

Retailers complained that London's designers couldn't deliver the goods and that what was delivered was often shoddily made. Designers blamed British manufacturers. Meanwhile, the mainstream was complaining that London was too wacky, too street-oriented. Then, with the advent of such young but terribly grown-up British designers as Jasper Conran and Alistair Blair, it was the avant-garde's turn to complain that London's street style was being washed away in a wave of fashions for the wealthy but unadventurous. This season is no different. But what's happening here is still fascinating in a way that can't be generalized. For every flaring Blair ball gown, there is an outrageous Vivienne Westwood bustier made of panels of satin and cotton knit, worn with a miniskirt shaped like an open umbrella that she calls a ''sealike crinifcule'' and a coat of blue Harris tweed.

It was thundering; there's not much like it in jazz. There's your answer.

INPUT:With the Columbus quincentenary being marked by a world's fair in Seville, the Olympics in Barcelona and a cultural feast in Madrid, Zaragoza has mobilized its most famous son -- Francisco de Goya -- to insure that it too is noticed during the Year of Spain. Not that Goya was from Zaragoza. He was born in 1746 in Fuendetodos, 26 miles south of here. He spent most of his life in Madrid. And he died in exile in Bordeaux, France, in 1828. But he began painting -- and frequently returned -- here. And above all, Zaragoza always claimed him as its own. To celebrate 1992, this city 175 miles northeast of Madrid is therefore staging its largest-ever exhibition of Goya's works, with 54 oils, 240 engravings and 4 lithographs. Spread over three different palaces, the exhibition opened on June 18 and closes on Oct. 18.

Accelerated efforts to improve the quality of life in nursing homes and enforce standards of care, which were ostensibly goals of a recent consumer guide from the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, may paradoxically increase public shame and intensify consumers' fears. As anticipated, data showing the failure of nursing homes were highlighted. Although the administrator of the health care administration, Dr. William L. Roper, cautioned the public that the report was a ''snapshot'' of conditions on the specific day that the survey was made, his remarks were downplayed by reporters. Furthermore, inaccuracies were found in the listing of deficiencies and other data.

High turnover and recruitment difficulties have caused shortages of home attendants.

At the same time, Republicans on the House Budget Committee suggested vast changes in Medicare, which would increase costs for many elderly beneficiaries. More than 43 million people receive Social Security, and 37 million are enrolled in Medicare. The annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security is based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. Republicans said their proposal was justified because the price index, in its current form, overstated inflation by as much as 1.5 percentage points. Many economists agree that there is some overstatement, but the amount is in dispute.

Now a friend of Mr. Nixon has released correspondence that reveals an aspect of fraternity between the two men. It is a fraternity of denial of responsibility, of inability to say mea culpa. Mr. Nixon, who resigned his Presidency in disgrace, wrote to Mr. Hart on May 11, three days after the former Colorado Senator withdrew as a Democratic Presidential candidate because of reports about his having spent time with a young woman not his wife. Mr. Hart had ''handled a very difficult situation uncommonly well,'' wrote the former President. ''What you said about the media needed to be said,'' he added. He referred to Mr. Hart's parting declaration that he was ''angry and defiant'' at a system that ''reduces the press of this nation to hunter and Presidential candidates to being hunted.'' It reminded many people of Mr. Nixon's famous ''last press conference'' in 1962, in which he told reporters, ''You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore.''

When the ''weatherball'' was red, warmer temperatures were ahead. When it was white, cold was on the way. Blinking indicated precipitation. Residents of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul may soon have a new way to assess quickly if their summer picnic is about to turn frosty. A digital typeface developed for a local graphic-design competition can change in response to such real-world factors as temperature fluctuations and traffic conditions. When a heat wave is imminent, motorists passing an electronic billboard might view an advertising message with rounded letters, while rectilinear text might signal an approaching cold front. Twin, as the interactive typeface is called, was created by Erik van Blokland and Just van Rossum, co-founders of the Dutch design firm LettError. They were commissioned to develop Twin by the University of Minnesota Design Institute, which invited six designers to submit proposals last year for a civic typeface that would represent the urban area. Their idea was chosen, and the prototype was unveiled on Saturday at a typography convention. The prototype can be seen at the Design Institute's Web site (design.umn.edu).

INPUT:The story that emerges piecemeal and out of sequence in ''Thief River,'' a new play by Lee Blessing, is about a lifelong love affair between two men. Furtively begun in high school, it continues into old age, even though they are separated early on by a terrible and violent event, and even though they are never together as a couple. Ray is the self-denying one who remains in their small Minnesota hometown to run the family farm; so fearful is he of being exposed as gay that he adopts a heterosexual life, marrying and having a son. The other man, Gil, is more straightforward about his identity, and that's one reason he has to leave. This is small-town America, after all, and the year, as the play begins, is 1948. The play, having its premiere production by the Signature Theater Company at the Peter Norton Space, stretches in time to the present, a span of more than half a century that makes its tale of frustrated love into a bit more of an epic than it can sustain. That Ray writes a letter to Gil every week for 25 years, for instance, in spite of their never laying eyes on each other seems more obsessive than romantic or passionate. But Mr. Blessing's narrative structure demands an expanse of decades; the play's characters are spread over five generations, from Ray's grandfather to Ray's grandson. And Mr. Blessing's storytelling is not only inventive but adroit.

''I live alone, and it's wonderful to know I'm coming home at night to a country club and the birdies chirping.'' She is part of a growing army of nontraditional home buyers that the Ginsburg Development Company, based in Hawthorne, N.Y., caters to in luxurious fashion at prices below those charged in lower Fairfield County. Two years ago, it opened an office in Danbury to oversee its portfolio of eight Connecticut projects, worth $347 million, some completed, others in various stages of development. Its entry into Connecticut consisted of 32 single-family clustered homes in Georgetown called Redding Ridge, which sold out rapidly. Summing up Ginsburg's marketing strategy, Joseph Novella, president of the Connecticut operations, said: ''We have blown away the concept of town houses as an entry type of housing. Some of it still is, but the luxury town homes and luxury multifamily communities that we develop meet the requirements of well-to-do nontraditional buyers.

But he acknowledged that there were no guarantees that relief and rehabilitation work could continue in all parts of the country and warned that increased fighting was very possible.

They were playing putt-putt golf during a vacation and after four holes, Pennington was in tears. His parents asked him what was wrong. Had he been stung by a bee? ''I'm behind two shots,'' Pennington wailed. Eric Mangini, the Jets' first-year coach, saw the latest signs of it. He popped in to the break room at the Jets' practice facility around 10 p.m. last Tuesday to grab a cup of coffee and ran into Pennington, who was fortifying himself with caffeine so he could last a couple of more hours in the film room.

Red pines have almost completely succumbed to scale. And now hemlocks and dogwoods are threatened. These are two of the most prized ornamentals for the home landscape as well as popular denizens of the forest. Perhaps the hardest hit of all is the Eastern hemlock. Foresters who know this tree well have reported seeing light in deep forests where there was none before, because the hemlocks have died. In the East these beautiful conifers have been hit with a double whammy. If they were not defoliated by the feeding of the gypsy moth larvae or hemlock scale, which weakened many trees, then the hemlocks were devastated by another insect pest, the woolly adelgid.

But Mr. Safire's "realities" accept the superficial judgments too many critics are reaching before serious consideration. Some reality checks: Reality 1: Mr. Safire is worried that four out of five insured Americans will have to pay for insuring that fifth person. In fact, that is what we are doing right now. Today, if an uninsured person needs treatment, he or she can find it only in a hospital emergency room. Those unpaid, unrecovered costs are simply passed on to insured patients.

That picturesque conceit has been realized in this unlikely city, the politically active but architecturally dull state capital of California. Here, the homeowners, a businessman and his art-collecting wife, commissioned a contemporary house extension -- studio, gallery, office and living room -- that cantilevers over an artificial but pastoral pond on the banks of the Sacramento River. Designed by the architect Mark Dziewulski, with the garden and pond by Haag Landscape Architecture, the clean, simple-looking marriage of water, concrete and glass was a complicated undertaking that belies the extension's setting. Tucked away behind hedges, bushes and trees are suburban backyards and bungalows. The client's wife, who grew up in Hawaii, has long loved water and tropical plants. In  1970, the couple bought a house in a residential neighborhood on the banks of the meandering Sacramento River, the city's natural preserve. They commissioned Ed Haag, a landscape architect, to build a koi pond in the courtyard.

And as I rang the doorbell (a surreal touch, but how else do you get into prison as a free man?) on a sodden Irish morning, it felt like that standard horror-movie scene where the innocent tries the knocker at a gothic mansion. Not that Mountjoy is exactly gothic, but its 19th-century granite grimness serves as well. As it was meant to. Mountjoy -- known here as ''the Joy'' -- is a relic of British rule. It was built in 1850 to strike fear into the hearts of a turbulent people and was kept busy in the early 1920s executing the most turbulent among them. What is called the hang-house still stands, ''complete with everything except the rope,'' as I was told by the cheerful guard who showed it to me and who demonstrated the mechanism with a certain pride. And so do the 1850s cells, radiating out from a central hub where the ''auld triangle,'' immortalized in verse by Brendan Behan, hangs on the wall. Everything at Mountjoy feels so museumlike it's hard to believe that it still functions. But it does: the largest, roughest, toughest prison in the Irish system. Life is better these days for the female inmates, who occupy a recently built annex. But for the 450 men, things are much as they were a century ago, with one notable exception. A century ago they would have spent their days picking oakum. Now the inmates of the Joy are making opera.

She is a dauntless improviser, someone who learns all of a song's structures in order to remake them on the spot, reinventing a melody line, toying with a rhythm, finding a note that would never seem to fit and then making it crown a chord. With her velvet-and-mahogany voice, she can turn a ballad into a luxurious, leisurely caress, dropping into a breathy low register near the baritone range; she can also scat-sing rings around a tune, bouncing syncopations against every offbeat but the expected one. Through the years, she has also rediscovered songs -- from failed musicals, from obscure movies -- that deserve to be part of the canon of pop standards. Outside the jazz circuit, Ms. Carter may still be best known for her days with the Lionel Hampton band (1948-51) and for the album she made with Ray Charles in 1961. She was also one of the very last singers to have worked with Miles Davis. In the 1970's and 80's, she was fiercely independent, recording for her own label and for Verve Records, and leading a lean jazz trio that has, through the years, discovered some superb musicians.

Members of the support staff made extra efforts as well. One committed box-office attendant was said to have biked all the way from Montclair, N.J. There was a special impetus to make this concert happen, though, because the pianist Alicia de Larrocha, a favorite at the festival since her first appearance there in 1971, was giving what was announced as her farewell Mostly Mozart performances. (The program was repeated on Saturday night.) Given the popularity of Ms. de Larrocha, the 80-year-old Spanish artist, it was no surprise that despite the travel impediments a sizeable audience turned out to hear her play Mozart's Piano Concerto in A (K. 488), conducted by Emmanuel Krivine.

This was in 1968, the year of the ''White Album,'' and I was still trying to figure out how to play ''Rocky Raccoon'' on my brand-new guitar, but I was also chewing my way through the selected works of Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington, Stan Kenton, Frank Sinatra and Peggy Lee, whose recording of ''Fever'' was -- shall we say -- instructive. Not that she was obvious about it, or anything else. If a Hitchcock blonde could have raised her voice in song, then Peggy Lee, who died on Monday at the age of 81, would have sounded pretty much like that, cool and self-possessed and amused. But even at 12, I got the message, and then some: what the lady on the record had in mind was pretty much what I had in mind 24 hours a day, except that her point of view was more informed. That was when I realized my father knew a thing or two about music. Thirty-four years later, I know a lot more about Peggy Lee, the English division of EMI having finally deigned to transfer the best of her albums to compact disc. I now know that ''Fever'' was the least of her. She was exquisite -- there is no other word for her. She floated atop a rhythm section like a soap bubble on a warm breeze, never raising her alto-flute voice a decibel more than absolutely necessary to get the exact effect she intended. She was a smart singer, the very opposite of all the cruel jokes some jazz instrumentalists like to tell about the women with whom they so often grudgingly share a bandstand. She chose her material with painstaking care, writing some of the best of it herself, and when she sang a song, it usually stayed sung. Other people do ''Don't Smoke in Bed'' and ''I've Got Your Number'' and ''You Came a Long Way From St. Louis,'' but when I hear them in my mind's ear, hers is the voice I hear.

INPUT:The Gramm-Rudman law to reduce the budget deficit requires a balanced budget by 1993. Under the act, next year's deficit target is $100 billion - which was met earlier this month in an agreement between Congress and the Bush Administration. Critics argue that the act is flawed and that the budget agreement was achieved through accounting tricks. Without these tricks, they say, the real deficit for next year would be $30 billion to $40 billion greater. Four experts on the budgeting process give their views on Gramm-Rudman and its future.  Stanley E. Collender  Director of Federal budget policy, Price Waterhouse. I don't think there will be any changes in Gramm-Rudman this year. Gramm-Rudman will not be scrapped. That would be a vote that most members of Congress could not afford to make. What is more likely is that rather than scrapping Gramm-Rudman, it will be stretched out by Congress. The target for the 1991 fiscal year is a $64 billion deficit. In actuality, the deficit is projected to be between $130 billion and $140 billion. That's too big a gap. Instead of achieving a balanced budget by 1993, we'll do it by 1995. The big problem with Gramm-Rudman is that it overpromised. It could never have reduced the defict by $36 billion a year, which was its target. When it didn't reach $36 billion a year there was frustration. The deficit was $221 billion in 1986. But by 1991 the deficit will be between $130 billion and $140 billion.

INPUT:Prudencio Irazabal  'Chromatomy: Recent Paintings'  Jack Shainman Gallery  560 Broadway, at Prince Street  SoHo  Through April 19 Seldom have surfaces been so deep as in these ''chromatic deconstructions'' by Prudencio Irazabal, a Spanish-born artist now living in New York City. At first glance, what the viewer sees is a top layer of imageless glasslike gloss that shimmers with subtle tonalities; a longer look reveals depths of color with faint grids and other phenomena under the skin. In the largest painting, ''Untitled No. 767,'' a four-panel work in brilliant red, the red segues into a hot glow of amber at the painting's center; in the smaller diptych ''Untitled No. 784,'' an intense gold with orange edges fades to a pale green center, with faint gold grid lines pulsing beneath. Mr. Irazabal creates his delicate color fields by building up layers of semitransparent pigment to thicknesses of an inch or more, stratifications that can be seen on the sides of the canvas. These nuanced distillations combine Op Art's sleight-of-eye appeal with the colors of, say, Venetian Old Masters to interesting effect. GRACE GLUECK

It does a disservice to prospective tourists and promotes the kind of safari experience antithetical to the spirit of the adventure. Very few visitors to Africa can afford the astounding rates charged by these camps and many must conclude, with no mention of alternatives, that such a trip is only a dream. Furthermore, going on a safari should mean getting close to nature, sampling how the African people live, roughing it to some extent. These luxury digs -- many with designer lodges, spas, infinity pools and gyms -- have created an artificial world more akin to Manhattan than Africa. Yes, the wealthy patrons take some walks and rides to see the animals, but the emphasis is on safari hedonism. Beyond the scope of these remarks is another issue: how much do the Africans themselves benefit?

They had not provided him with the equilibrium he needed to steady himself on the ice-covered slope that was a three-run home run by Scott Brosius. The Red Sox simply had not been able to fare much better against Andy Pettitte in the first six innings than the Yankees had against Martinez. One run was all Pettitte allowed in the eight innings he pitched.

In Washington, the Bush Administration continued to avoid any explicit promise to refrain from such kidnappings, while the State Department repeated its pledge to extend "full respect for the sovereign rights and prerogatives" of Mexico. The confrontation arose Monday when the United States Supreme Court asserted the right of the United States to kidnap a criminal suspect from another country, in effect sanctioning the seizure of a Mexican gynecologist in 1990. The Mexico Foreign Ministry angrily criticised the decision and said it would suspend United States drug enforcement activities in Mexico.

He uses the findings of a Labor Department study to contend that 70 percent of workers displaced from 1993 to 1995 found new jobs by February 1996. That figure masks the reality underlined by the Labor Department study: Of those 70 percent re-employed, 204,000 found only part-time jobs and 926,000 found jobs paying below their previous earnings. Added to these are the 1.3 million who did not find new jobs at all. Thus, 65 percent -- almost two-thirds -- of those who lost jobs in the mid-1990's either did not find new jobs, found only part-time jobs or found jobs paying below their previous earnings.

A NEW BEGINNING -- With pledges of support from the United States and other Western allies, Mr. Karzai and a 29-member cabinet, including 2 women, assumed office in ceremonies in Kabul before 2,000 international dignitaries and Afghan leaders, many of whom wept at the spectacle of the first peaceful transfer of power in their country in years.

It needs a new constitution, a new legal system, courts and a security force to end lawlessness; it needs jobs, health care, schools, agricultural reforms and on and on -- virtually everything a nation provides for everyday life.

While eminent domain in the past was generally limited to government projects, like roads or public buildings, or to what used to be known as slum clearance, local governments are increasingly finding it convenient to use eminent domain to clear land for private development that will enhance the tax base.

Let's say there were an election in which one candidate is expected to win most of the popular votes in the Northeastern states, but not necessarily New York.

The committee chairman, William Bartholomay of the Atlanta Braves, declined to identify the remaining candidates but said: "We all hope Bud Selig would reconsider, but he maintains his position. He has extraordinary support from all aspects of ownership. The committee wouldn't be continuing if he was willing to go on." Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, has served as acting commissioner -- in his role as chairman of the major league executive council -- for the past year. But he has steadfastly refused to accept a draft from an increasing number of owners to take the job on a permanent basis.

Visually, these scenes from Democratic commercials have the feel of an illicit gathering, recorded on the sly. That, of course, is the Democrats' design: In advertisements running throughout the country in the final three weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Democrats are trying to turn the Republicans' "Contract With America" into a dark and frightening ceremony -- and along the way, meet some urgent political needs. Democrats are hoping that the political extravaganza staged by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia on the Capitol steps last month, when 300 Republican candidates committed to the "contract" of political promises, can be used to galvanize core Democratic voters, strip away the Republicans' image as a party of outsiders and turn the political debate to a much less dangerous terrain.

Therefore, I was prepared to receive the Catholic Church's recent pronouncement on homosexuality and same-sex unions (''Vatican Exhorts Legislators to Reject Same-Sex Unions,'' front page, Aug. 1) as simply more of the same dogma-laden boilerplate that I stopped taking seriously years ago. But given what has come to light in the last 18 months regarding the church's past policy on pedophile priests, I cannot contain my anger and disgust at its use of phrases like ''approval of deviant behavior,'' ''doing violence to these children,'' and ''against the natural moral law.'' Does not child molestation constitute deviant behavior and violence to children? And do not repeated cover-ups of said molestation imply approval, and a threat to natural moral law?

The vans, which ply bus stops in the boroughs and siphon riders from the city's buses, have increasingly become an irritation to the city and Transit Authority, costing the authority $60 million a year in lost fares. Under the bill, which Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is expected to sign, the city would be given the power to regulate and license livery vans. That would allow the city to stop the pirate vans, which officials maintain are unsafe, from operating and also give the city the ability to use vans, in some way, in the city's transit system.

INPUT:The Cold War and American Science  The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at M.I.T. and Stanford  By Stuart W. Leslie  Illustrated. 332 pages. Columbia University Press. $42. In "The Cold War and American Science," Stuart W. Leslie, a professor in the department of the history of science at Johns Hopkins University, takes off from the theme of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's only memorable phrase: his warning against the unwarranted influence of "the military-industrial complex." Mr. Eisenhower used the words in his farewell address on Jan. 17, 1961, just before leaving the White House, but its significance echoes to the present time of big-power peace. Professor Leslie extends the Eisenhower phrase to include the major universities that depend on Pentagon contracts for their research laboratories: the "military-industrial-academic complex." (He credits Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, an early opponent of the Vietnam War, for adding the word "academic.") The author argues that with the end of the cold war, there's even less reason for the universities to put their brainpower to work for the Pentagon and the arms merchants.

They remember the flush days of the late 1980's when collectors elbowed one another to be the first through the heavy carved oak doors of the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan, dropping several million dollars on a chic little table or a pair of unusual chairs. But they also remember the bleak years of the early 90's when the crowds came but almost nobody spent. Just how this year's show, which opens today and runs through Thursday, will be affected by the worldwide financial crisis is yet to be seen.  As usual, the offerings are broad and the booths glamorous. A walk around the show provides a look at everything from a $3 million Cezanne still life to a $100 delft tile and a $40 18th-century silver mustard spoon. Dealers hope the art market will continue to rise as it did in 1987 after Black Monday. ''I haven't seen a client yet who says he's feeling too broke to buy,'' said Edward Munves, owner of James Robinson, a Park Avenue gallery specializing in antique jewelry and silver.

In recent days, NASA headquarters has sent out dozens of letters to officials letting them know that they will be reassigned or will have to leave the agency, and has canceled a closely watched contract with a company that had been brought in to improve the agency's much-criticized safety culture. The departing official, Craig Steidle, is a retired Navy admiral whom Dr. Griffin's predecessor, Sean O'Keefe, hired in January 2004 to lead the Office of Exploration Systems. Once Dr. Griffin was confirmed in April, he quickly reversed central elements of Admiral Steidle's plan for vehicles to succeed the space shuttle, calling for plans that could lead to a more rapid development at lower cost, and with more of the technical decisions being resolved within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and not by the contractors.

INPUT:NO other major league baseball team has such a grimy ghost in the attic of its history. Even in the glow of the Chicago White Sox's return to the World Series, the franchise is again haunted, and always will be, by what happened in 1919. Had eight members of that season's White Sox team not conspired with gamblers to lose the World Series, the term ''Black Sox'' would not be in baseball's vocabulary. But what is often forgotten is that those ''Eight Men Out,'' the title of Eliot Asinof's classic book and the film directed by John Sayles, almost got away with the fix. Despite all the whispers during that Series and the 1920 season, baseball gambling in that era was not criminally explored until suspicions concerned, oddly, the uptown Cubs. Before a game at Wrigley Field on Aug. 31, 1920, thousands of dollars were reportedly bet on the last-place Philadelphia Phillies because of a suspected fix. When the Cubs lost, 3-0, a Cook County grand jury was convened to investigate that Cubs game as well as baseball gambling in general.

INPUT:Any concert by the Kronos Quartet is partly a sociological affair in which extramusical effects and ideology have as large a role as the compositions. The group's first recital in Carnegie Hall on Thursday night was no exception. It brought together Allen Ginsberg and mystical Minimalism, shards of rock music and iconoclastic compositional methods, along with all the customary Kronos accouterments. Instead of traditional, undistracting staging, the players were raised on black platforms and seated in chairs wrapped with a black elastic material. Instead of wearing nondescript concert dress, the players had on varieties of hip fashion (discarding their punk look of a few years ago). The first violinist, David Harrington, said in a profile in the program that the quartet toured with its own lighting director because ordinary concert lighting provided no way for the audience "to concentrate on what we were doing, what the music was." Actually, though, the purpose of Kronos's lighting seems just the reverse: the blue, green, yellow and red mood lights add yet another variable distracting from the music. Speakers and electronics are given a euphemistic spin: "We don't think of it as amplifying so much as enlarging."

"The reality is that trends like unwed motherhood, rising divorce rates, smaller households and the feminization of poverty are not unique to America, but are occurring worldwide."

The Government on Friday approved measures that would lengthen the maximum prison terms for cases in which the kidnapping victims are ill, very young or very old. Particularly cruel treatment, like the occasional practice of slicing off a victim's ear, would be dealt with more harshly. Italians who have information about a kidnapping but observe the code of omerta, or silence, could be jailed for three years.

''It was such a necessity,'' he said recently, emphasizing the word ''necessity.'' ''We had so many excellent, talented musicians in the individual school bands, and all that was fine, but I felt they needed something more.'' Mr. Alshin, who eventually became director of strings and orchestra for the Scarsdale school system, is now retired and living in Sarasota, Fla. His idea, however, lives on: in the form of the Westchester Junior String Orchestra, a 46-member group of seventh, eighth and ninth graders from all over the county who play violin, viola, cello and bass. The orchestra rehearses weekly at the County Center, performs classical music and a few pop selections at four to six concerts a year locally and goes on an annual tour. The orchestra is sponsored by the County Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation and by the Greater Westchester Youth Orchestra, a nonprofit organization that raises money for the high school-age Westchester Youth Symphony. It is also supported by a group of volunteer parents known as the ''friends.''

INPUT:On Tuesday, Queens voters in the Sixth Congressional District will choose a replacement for the recently retired Rev. Floyd Flake. They will not get much help from party labels. Assemblyman Gregory Meeks is the Democratic nominee. State Senator Alton Waldon Jr., a Democrat, is running on the Independent and Conservative lines, even though he seems to agree with none of the Conservative Party's agenda. Barbara Clark, the 21st Century Party candidate, is a Democratic Assemblywoman who formed her own party for this race. Celestine Miller, a Republican and a district school superintendent, was also a Democrat until two months ago. The Republican Party is pouring resources into Ms. Miller's campaign. Her commitment to education is impressive, but on other issues she seems fuzzy. She can best serve Queens by continuing her important work in the schools. The three Democrats appear to be almost interchangeable in matters of issue and ideology. They differ in style and, most important, in their political alliances. This race is wound up with the ambitions of veteran Queens politicians like the mayoral hopeful Alan Hevesi, the gubernatorial candidate Peter Vallone and Mr. Flake, who has retired from Congress but not from the political battlefield. Senator Waldon feels he had the Congressional nomination sewed up until the Democratic powers joined forces to support Mr. Meeks. Mr. Waldon has stories of political betrayal to tell, but his attempt to portray himself as the victimized independent are unrealistic. Voters who are looking for a politician who bucks the system will be more attracted to Ms. Clark, who has gone her own way both in Queens politics and in the State Legislature. Shut out by her party, she did an impressive job of rallying her supporters and quickly collecting thousands of signatures to run as a third-party candidate.

INPUT:THE ARABISTS The Romance of an American Elite. By Robert D. Kaplan. Illustrated. 333 pp. New York:  The Free Press. $24.95. ON his way home from Iraq in June 1983, an American engineer named Robert Spurling was separated from his wife and three daughters at Saddam International Airport and thrown in jail. Accused of spying for Israel, he was tortured for three months. Electrodes were attached to his genitals and his fingernails were pulled out. The charges were trumped up; eventually, Mr. Spurling was set free. The man who ordered the torture, President Saddam Hussein's half brother Barzan Ibrahim al-Takriti, later became Iraq's human rights delegate in Geneva. At the time, the State Department did not publicize the atrocity. The Arabists who have long dominated the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs were eager to believe that Saddam Hussein was a man who could be worked with. He was, after all, the enemy of America's enemy, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. His nation was, for all its brutality, the best hope for "secular modernism" in the Middle East. So when Saddam Hussein gassed several thousand Kurds in 1988, American diplomats argued that the incident had to be put in "perspective." It was just such institutional myopia that led the United States Ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, to foolishly flatter Saddam Hussein a few days before he invaded Kuwait in August 1990.

INPUT:With Congress deadlocked on how to protect medical privacy, the Clinton administration has taken an important but incomplete first step in addressing the problem by proposing new federal regulations. Under the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Congress was supposed to pass a medical privacy law by August 1999. Because Congress failed to meet that deadline, the administration is required to develop regulations. The issuing of administrative rules, however, does not diminish the need for Congress to pass comprehensive legislation. Dramatic changes in the medical industry mean that the flow of medical information is no longer limited to private notes jotted into a patient's folder at the doctor's office. The rise of computerization and health care networks serving hundreds of thousands of patients have made it possible to compile detailed patient information in databanks that can be shared by doctors, insurers, researchers, employers, pharmacists and others. This offers useful ways to track medical outcomes, monitor patient care and assess physician competence. But it can also result in a loss of confidentiality, a prospect that is causing justified concern about an erosion of privacy between doctors and patients. Currently there is no federal law prohibiting the disclosure of personal medical records to employers, marketing firms and other entities for reasons unrelated to medical care without a patient's knowledge or consent. Some states do have privacy laws, but the patchwork of state laws can lead to confidential information being passed on for inappropriate uses.

With the Yonkers Federation of Teachers, which has been working without a contract since June 1994 but voted not to strike last Wednesday night, the status of labor negotiations with teachers in other districts is compelling. Although the current academic year is barely through the first semester, the agreements are having an effect on school budgets, which will be presented next  spring.

That was the crux of today's debate in the State House of Representatives over a bill that would bar state and city officials who are candidates for election from appearing in publicly financed broadcast advertisements. And the spotlight was on Mr. Rowland, a Republican, whose administration has spent about $1.6 million in a radio and television campaign that features him and his wife bantering over the delights of visiting Connecticut. ''These ads don't help Connecticut families, they help John Rowland,'' complained a press release from Representative Barbara B.

INPUT:To the Editor: I write on behalf of my sister, Ruth Levitan of Stamford, Conn., and myself to protest Sam Tanenhaus's review of Daniel P. Moynihan's ''Secrecy: The American Experience'' (Oct. 4). In that review our father, Harry Dexter White, is once again vilified as a ''Soviet agent.'' Tanenhaus apparently bases this identification on the statements supposedly made in Canada in 1945 by a Russian defector, Igor Gouzenko. These, he says, offered ''stark confirmation'' that White and Alger Hiss were members of a North American spy ring. Quite apart from the question of Gouzenko's credibility -- which Tanenhaus curiously takes for granted -- it is difficult to see how, in calmer times, such statements could be cited as proof of anyone's guilt of anything. According to Tanenhaus, Gouzenko ''had no names'' and ''identified a number of agents by profession only.'' No problem! Tanenhaus assures us that thanks to J. Edgar Hoover's legendary creative powers, he ''was able to connect the dots'' -- in other words, to construct a frame.

Particularly upsetting, school officials said, was the song "Ugg-a-Wugg," in which Indians speak of "the brave noble redskin" and sing childish doggerel like "Ibbity Bibity Bibity Bibity Sab!"

INPUT:IN 1931 Harold Edgerton invented the process of stroboscopic photography. Its revolutionary component was a very fast reusable flash that allowed microseconds, a frozen moment, to be captured on film. Edgerton trained the new tool on a wide variety of subjects, and scientist that he was, he produced some of the most bizarre but memorable images in American photography. Edgerton, who was born in 1903 and died in 1990, left a cache of his photographs to the Whitney Museum of American Art and 75 of them are at the Stamford branch of the Whitney in ''Quicker Than a Wink: The Photographs of Harold Edgerton.'' The works are guaranteed to engage viewers and frequently to make them gasp. Edgerton does not create -- he's a scientist not an artist -- rather he brings to light what others cannot comprehend or take in from the world around us. The approach sometimes produces the eerie feeling that Edgerton is revealing the hidden order of the universe: in one of his pictures a lawn sprinkler sprays countless bright spots that look like stars atwinkle in the night sky. This leads to the shivery thought that perhaps the big bang came out of a gigantic sprinkler.

And, he held top positions in the Reagan Administration. In this case, appearances are deceiving. Mr. Monks is the scourge of many executive suites for his outspoken - and influential - views on corporate proxy battles. From a Georgetown office, Mr. Monks, 56 years old, heads a consulting business that for a fee advises more than 100 institutions, including the mammoth employee pension funds of New York City and California, on how to vote their proxies. And he has been a behind-the-scenes player in recent proxy contests, with victories at the Lockheed Corporation and Honeywell Inc. For Mr. Monks, shareholder activism is a calling and he minces no words on its behalf. ''American chief executives are close to becoming the absolute monarchs that we saw in the 18th century,'' he said in an interview. ''Managements of large American corporations are only accountable to themselves.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. we may think of his willingness to challenge the system of segregation or his denunciation of our Government's involvement in the Vietnam War or his determination to continue his nonviolent protests despite persistent death threats, or all of these. But Dr. King demonstrated his courage in yet another way. In examining how black leaders had attempted to offer solutions to social and economic injustice, he did not hesitate to reject whatever did not harmonize with the basic requirements of nonviolent resistance. He did this at the risk of losing the support of many who treasured the legacies of these black leaders. Booker T. Washington, in his Atlanta Exposition Address of 1895, advised blacks to apply their intelligence and skill first to the common occupations of life rather than to political activity and denounced as folly any agitation on questions of social equality. Although he appealed to blacks and whites to cultivate friendly relations with each other for mutual progress, he emphasized that blacks and whites could be separate in all that was purely social.

The study, by the Construction Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers, offers a first glimpse of the effect the attacks are likely to have on the physical structure and insurance costs for a renewed trade center and perhaps for other large buildings. The study also recommends that all buildings at the site be designed to accommodate mass evacuations. Until now, the practice has been to assume that just a few floors would be evacuated at a time.

Friday night in Avery Fisher Hall, Musica Sacra devoted an entire concert to two of them. There is ample precedent for mixing jazz and third-stream religious composition - Duke Ellington stands out - and ample commissioning opportunities for those who do so. Churches all over the world, especially in the American heartland, still maintain big choruses and like to hear new music written for them -as long as it isn't expressed in idioms that puzzle or shock. Such patrons tend to avoid the knotty dissonance of the modernists or jazz vanguardists and the raucous aggression of rock-and-rollers (not that many true rockers would have the inclination or the technique for such work). Richard Westenburg and Musica Sacra have performed Mr. Brubeck's liturgical music before. Friday's program was devoted to the nearly hourlong ''Mass: To Hope!'' of 1980 and the new Variations on ''Pange Lingua,'' which lasts 35 minutes.

No matter the target, he would fulminate about Washington's arrogance, invoke Russia's nuclear might, even warn of World War III. Mr. Yeltsin's outbursts were brief but ferocious, and they reflected a widespread conviction among Russians that deep down, America's interests were different from theirs. Now comes Vladimir Putin -- by instinct and training a less likely friend of the United States than was Mr. Yeltsin -- to offer support in our struggle against terrorism. His presence on President Bush's bandwagon is more than just a reversal of Russian policy on America's use of force. Mr. Putin, unlike his predecessor, seems to believe that there is a domestic consensus, or that he can create one, in favor of a broad rapprochement between Russia and the West. This offers huge potential payoffs for American policy, and both sides should work hard to make it a reality. Mr. Putin showed his readiness to do so this week, in a statement that seemed to relax Russia's opposition to the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Bush administration is reciprocating with talk of speeding up Russia's admission to the World Trade Organization.

The hospital was built in 1927 on a filled-in pond, at a time when Bay Ridge was lower and swampier. Today it still rises above most of its surroundings -- the Dyker Beach Golf Course stretching toward the water, Poly Prep school lying on a grassy patch to the south -- and is backed by the sweeping, string-of-pearls cables of the bridge. Every hospital has its specialty, and for Victory it is childbirth. Half the neighborhood seems to have made its debut behind the glass walls of its maternity ward, once run by a team of stern nurses, some of whom lived in a three-story brick-and-marble house on hospital grounds. So last week, when neighbors learned that Victory Memorial would probably close, it was only natural that it was the births they remembered.
